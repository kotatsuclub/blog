I need to come up with something awesome.\n\nGod, since I have so much time now, I really should make that VN I wanted to make. I always say I’ll do something and never do. I really should do something I say I’ll do.\n\nI never learned anything about writing, but I kinda figured it out myself, I think. I still need to actually learn the stuff, but I think I have nice concepts of settings, characters, and plot for an armature work, since I was working on it since I was, like, 5.\n\nSo if I ever do make one, you will be the music guy, Chris, since you seem to have a musical talent.\n\nThat should make me a little bit more awesome, I guess, and not fail as a media officer.",

I do agree that most one-season anime tend to feel rushed. I tend to like stories that take their time to completely flesh out their universe. It just feels more… complete. That being said, 3 of my top 5 anime are twelve(ish) episodes (GRZ, Madoka, Bakemonogatari).\n\nEnjoyed the read, can’t wait till your next one."

You should give this link to all the anime writers that are writing for 12 episode series, and maybe you’ll save anime!\n\nOh, and I agree with Chaeha, you seem to have a talent for music. Chaeha will do writing, I’ll do game design stuff, you can do music, now we need a voice actor and someone who can draw.",
