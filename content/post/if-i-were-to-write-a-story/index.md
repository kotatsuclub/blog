It would probably be set in this kind of world.

World Description

<!--more-->

It was a world full of fighters, the strong and those who aspired to be.  A world ranking showed the relative skill levels of all those who participated in the system.  In this world, it was a generally accepted rule that open battles were not allowed; battles were to take place in magically created protected battle zones, in which no one would die.  However, there was no true law.  As a replacement, power became “law”.  The strongest were free to do as they pleased; the weak had to take care not to oppose those stronger on their journey to become strong themselves.

People’s lives were based on energy.  You could augment the power of your attacks using your energy, and you could even attack with pure energy itself.  Taking damage from attacks would reduce your energy.  As long as you had energy left in your body, you would remain alive.  When your energy fell too low, your body and mind would shut down in an attempt to preserve and recover your energy.  There was a certain limit though, and when your energy fell below this limit, even if you were still alive, you were said to be in an unrecoverable state.  Your body would use up your last remaining energy and your existence would fade away.  The amount of energy required to save a person from an unrecoverable state was so great that it was considered impossible for any one person, or even groups of people, to provide such an amount; hence the name unrecoverable.

A person’s amount of energy was not something that could be determined exactly.  You could speak in general of the levels of a person’s energy, but those levels often fluctuated in unpredictable ways.  Sometimes such things as emotion or desire alone could cause large jumps in energy for short time periods.  General training would increase overall energy over time: after using up your energy, it would recover to a slightly higher level than before.

Energy could be released in various forms by different people.  Other than pure energy based forms, elemental energy was the most common alternate form, producing such things as fire and water skills.  Energy type and power also depended on your weapon: swords were designed mostly with the intent of using the user’s energy to create stronger sword attacks, and staffs were designed usually to concentrate the user’s energy and fire it off in blasts.  Of course, there were various weapon levels as well, with higher level swords and staffs being able to handle greater amounts of energy or to release the energy in a different form or with more force.

It was a curious thing to note that the new people in the world seemed to appear out of nowhere with a weapon and some place to stay.  The people in general gathered in small villages or towns to live.  These villages and towns were all situated on one continent, whose edge was surrounded by a thick mist.  The whole of the continent appeared to be floating: if you went over the edge, it seemed as if you would fall endlessly.  No one knew if other worlds existed beyond the mist.

This world would have its heroes and its villains, its epic battles and its decisive moments, its dark periods and its times of hope.  The stories of these people and these moments would remain, forever preserved in legends.

I made a calculator RPG based on this world a while ago.  This intro would have fit really well with the start of the game, especially that last paragraph.  Imagine reading that and then the game starts with the title screen saying, “The Legends of Swords and Magic, Part 3 (or whatever number part it was).”  Well, it sounds cool to me at least.

There is more to it, but I probably won’t post it unless someone finds it interesting.
