            "Content": "Upon discussing Shinryaku! Ika musume with friends who had seen it, I received a\n\nTROLLFAYES.JAYPEG\n\nat which point the show made sense to me.\n\nThe best way I’ve heard to describe PSG is Powerpuff Girls meets DeadLeaves. If you haven’t seen DeadLeaves go watch it; same themes as the first few episodes of PSG, but with more action.\n\nI was hoping to get 俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない (Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga nai… \u003c3 Gene) out of the hat, but oh well. I'm excited for next semester when we get to watch all of the GOOD shows from the fall.\n\nI'm also looking forward to the next two weeks with ZOMBEHS this coming week and horror animes (including my favorite) the week after.",

That’s the show I was most interested in, too, even though I haven’t seen any bit of it yet. I guess I just like the concept too much.\n\nI’m also looking forward to the next couple weeks. From what everyone says, it sounds like these are always fun nights."
