Yo, guys! Grant here again, just creating a post about last night’s showing. Again, I’ll just be going over my own thoughts on every anime, and then it’ll be open to idle discussion from there. To refresh everyone’s memories, the three shows we watched were: Arakawa Under the Bridge (Season TWO), Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt, and Shinryaku! Ika Musume.

First, Arakawa seems to be moving along pretty much exactly the same as the first season. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though. The show can still make me laugh, and introducing new characters seems like a good idea. We already see Last Samurai and Billy (and his girl, whatever her name is) getting more screen time, along with the Amazoness and her hen tengu… we’ll have to see how things go from here. I still think it’s a funny show, and there isn’t much else I can really say about it.

Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt was… well, I can’t say it was everything I expected it to be–but who could expect the kind of stuff this show throws at you? This anime was also hilarious, and the action was often still pretty neat, but this was definitely a show made to get laughs, which I think it succeeded in doing. I know I definitely had a lot to laugh at, here. The show is often obscene and gross (I mean, come on, the first thing they do is fight a shit monster), but there’s obviously a lot of thought in the satire there. I wouldn’t be surprised to find myself finishing this show. Like I think others have said, if I had to compare it to one show, it would be The Powerpuff Girls, except Panty & Stocking is most definitely not for kids.

Our last show was Shinryaku! Ika Musume and I just have to say (caps inc)… OH GOD THANK YOU GENE FOR SHOWING US THIS WONDERFUL ANIME IT IS SO BRILLIANT AND–well, okay, no, my thoughts don’t actually go like this. Don’t get me wrong, though–I don’t dislike the show at all. I just don’t think it’s really my thing. It was funny, though, but for some reason I don’t see myself appreciating it as much as the comedy in, say, Arakawa. It’s funny at times, but I suppose I just can’t see myself watching any more of it. Maybe I was just expecting more tentacle yuri? Koff.

That’s about everything I have to say about the showing. Feel free to discuss, or not, whatever you guys like.

See you all next week!
