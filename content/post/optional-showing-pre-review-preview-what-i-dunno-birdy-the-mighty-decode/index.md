I thought about letting this wait until after the Thursday showing, where hopefully a handful of you would have gotten a chance to see it (the only reason I already have is because I won’t be here, so I watched a bit with Gene and Chris last night), but I’m leaving campus in a few hours and needed something to do, so I thought opening discussion on this early wouldn’t be too bad. That way, anybody who’s already seen it or has read the original manga or the 1996 OVA could go ahead and talk about it.

However, I should be polite and mention that there is a decent chance of spoilers in this post. Nothing humongous, but I’ll probably discussing some events up to the episode I watched (since last night we watched, what? Five episodes? Six?). They won’t be marked, since this is the only warning.

First, my overall impression of the anime: it’s not bad. I will probably finish it, just to see what happens. It’s not the greatest thing I’ve seen, as it kind of has its share of cheese, but even with the abundance of joking and mocking remarks we had about the show it was still something enjoyable–for me, at least. I also kind of like the ED, in case it matters.

The show is generally about a thoroughly unlikeable guy, Senkawa (who I believe Gene described as “like Shinji [from Evangelion], but retarded,” and not in any charming fashion, I might add), who gets accidentally punched in half by Birdy (essentially a space cop action girl with body armor any man can enjoy; it’s naturally safe to say she’s the real main character here, in case the title of the show didn’t give that way), who decides to make it up to him by letting his consciousness share her body until his is ‘rebuilt’ by space furries some handful of lightyears away.

That last paragraph may have given you a bad impression. But don’t worry: it gets marginally worse. Senkawa, because he wants you to hate him that badly, is pissed off at this arrangement because he would obviously rather be dead. He also doesn’t like that Birdy likes to go saving the universe when he could be _failing midterms_ or _going to get-well parties_. There were plenty of lulz about this at the showing.

Despite all that, though, the show really isn’t that bad. It’s actually very well animated, and I was always intrigued by the sort of things Birdy could pull off in the combat scenes. The story is sometimes absurd (but I can feel it going somewhere), and the characters aren’t always lovable, but at least they aren’t _boring_, and Birdy herself is actually a pretty cool character, since even if she is kind of a generic action girl, she isn’t incredibly ditzy about what she does, so she doesn’t end up coming off as obnoxious.

As Gene informed me, Decode is sort of a remake. The first Birdy there is, I presume, from the 1996 OVA, and the second is our current model. She’s been given a pretty obvious makeover in favor of more modern definitions of attractiveness and moe, but she still works pretty well as a heroine.

Anyway, I can’t really think of anything else to say about it. It’s a decent show and I hope that if you plan on seeing it on Thursday or have already seen it, you enjoy/enjoyed it. I’ll probably keep watching to get the rest of the story, so maybe some of you can dissuade or encourage me on that.

Thanks for reading! I’ll see you all next semester. Happy holidays and whatnot.
