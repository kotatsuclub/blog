            "Content": "I’ve got to say, despite all the things I can pick apart about this show (as evidenced by my plethora of commentary on Monday), this show isn’t bad. The characters and story aren’t mind-blowingly original, but then again, few actually are (especially considering the original manga was written in 1985, and the original OVA was in 1996). The story is well-written enough that it makes the cliches tolerable, and that’s all I can really ask for when watching/reading anything from any country.\n\nAs for Senkawa, perhaps there’s hope for him yet…some of the most memorable characters for me have been those I initially hated, precisely because they overcame those character flaws and developed into something more respectable (like Simon from TTGL). To be honest, I’d rather see a character like that than one that’s totally badass right off the bat. Of course, that’s assuming that Senkawa _does_ get better. (On a side note, despite all my contempt for Shinji’s character, I suppose I can half-forgive him due to what he represents as a character archetype)"
