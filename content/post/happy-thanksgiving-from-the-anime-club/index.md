EDIT: The post below this one is newer. Read that!

Hope you all enjoyed your Thanksgiving. Remember the Indians? Yeah, me neither.

It should come as a surprise to no one that I have been the least productive person this Thanksgiving. Even more unproductive than Chris, who somehow managed to finish his nearly 5000-word masterpiece that’ll probably get posted while I’m getting mauled by type-B diabetic women trying to buy inexpensive computers from Best Buy. I was supposed to watch Garden of Sinners and some other stuff, but instead wound up crawling to the Yosuga no Sora folder, just to see what the fuss was all about. This is a mistake I’ll be soon to regret, because not long after finishing episode 6, my heart exploded.

I suppose its not all bad, I mean, there are worse things. It should be let known that I watched some better shows worth some people’s time instead. Like Kanon, and Arakawa under the bridge.{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/1290624724880-300x168.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/1290624724880.jpg" width="300" height="168">}} I can’t emphasize enough the balance you have to strike while watching anime. There’s only so much bad stuff you can take before you start doing awful things to your twin sister or undressing in front of a maid. I did neither, but this happens in Yosuga no Sora. Sometimes more than once. Why would anyone do that? Think about it.

I ate a lot of turkey. Who knew that in order to make a perfect Thanksgiving turkey, all you have to do is cook it upside down for half the time its cooking? Apparently it makes the white meat taste less like the Saharan Desert. Unfortunately the stuffing got burnt and so did the pumpkin pie, but [it can’t be helped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikata_ga_nai). Like anime, you have to take the good with the bad and consider yourself lucky to have had anything at all. Even if most of the things you have are waiting for the main character to get raped.

Oh yeah, and the shows for next semester are being decided, and are mostly done. Suggestions will be either ignored or politely listened to. Then promptly ignored. Stuff you can forget about me showing:

- Kimi ni Todoke 2
- Starry Sky
- Wolverine
- Anything by Studio DEEN

There’s a lot to be excited about next semester. Since there isn’t much in the way of anime series, there’s still plenty of great OVAs and movies that are coming out, so that’s mostly what’ll get a lot of attention next semester. Again, Happy Turkey day!
