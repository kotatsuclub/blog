##### You had ONE JOB


The lens through which one views anime is always through their own life. Anime means different things to different people, and an anime critic always feels compelled to explain what garbage seeped into their lives that led them to this point: writing about anime. Anime was as cheap as the ramen I ate through college. It may not have been good, but it was better than nothing and there was a LOT of it available.

######And easily economized
Anime doesn’t rank high as an artistic medium, much less as even quality television. A vast majority is selling you something, maybe sex or most certainly merchandising. The rare ones sell you on an idea. Where this understanding breaks down is the glib nature of reviews elsewhere. For example, one such glowing review of ShiroBako by then-newly hired Nick Creamer at ANN describes it as “very pretty” and “featuring a cast of actual adults.” Sorry for taking shots at Nick, because it’s not just him. The fact is, reviewing anime is hard. Others more creatively praise the names that work on it, but fanwanking aside, an anime should stand on its own without brand recognition.

######This is why I’ll crucify kancolle

So here’s my best shot at it for 2015. Anime was “pretty good” and “used to be better,” but we’re going to pretend other years didn’t happen. Shirobako was so good, it almost made me believe that nothing else of merit came out this year. I’m not sorry about spoiling my number 1, you’re not even reading this part. You'll look at the titles tied to the numbers and ask me why I picked them in the first place. The clues will be in the criteria for how anime are selected for this list:

1.	The series ENDED in 2015 (this disqualifies Osomatsu-san, note to self- future me)
2.	No sequels or movies (disqualifies a LOT of good things)
3.	Arbitrarily ranked based on things I liked about it. Let’s not pretend otherwise.

And awaaaayyyy we go!

###10.  Prison School
######*Kangaku Gakuen*

Last time I made one of these lists my number 10 anime was assumed as a title I actually considered *good*. As it was then, the anime slotted into the number 10 spot is a very soft recommendation. Prison School should be praised for the absurdity of its humor that only a Japanese anime could deliver. The premise that a small prison at a previously all-female high school is at least a unique one, where typical romantic anime tropes are traded for cold cynicism of men's expectations of - and for - sex.

Prison School gruesomely explores sexuality from both genders' perspectives, in the only way it could: with a acute dose of bathroom humor and an obtuse obsession with bathrooms. For delivering laughs in an unexpected way, Prison School nets a spot on this list. It gets the 10-spot for doing so in a brusque, overtly offensive, and at times nauseating way that can obfuscate the rather gender-equal message it sometimes delivers.

It's the flaming bag of poo prank on your doorstep, where sometimes you're the pranker, and other times the one who's pranked. Sometimes it's hilarious, other times you're just disgusted.

###9. Everyday Life With Monster Girls
######Monster Musume

In case you haven't closed the tab after reading all of the above, congratulations. You probably have some faith still that this list contains anime you probably consider better than this one. More good news, I thrash your favorite anime after I'm done with this list too. Still got this tab open? Great. Let's talk about "monster waifus."

Monster Musume is based on a manga of the same name, but before that, the artist was literally drawing porn of monster girls. When he found out there's more money to be made by going legit (ask Fakku), Okayado made the manga more ecchi, a word which here means: less sketchy. The manga world he writes strictly bans sex with the monsters, leaving instead a show about the monsters themselves coexisting with humanity. The theme leftover is rather distinctly about accepting those around us that are different from ourselves.

Theme aside, the show still embraces its deviant roots, with spot nudity and fanservice abound. At a 9-spot, again, its as hard a sell as Prison School was, if not more. As for impactful anime of 2015, it certainly sets a standard.

I still have a strong distaste for fanservice shows, but only because they lacked substance. For what little substance this show offered, it offered a relatable sentiment to be considered better than the things I'll be dismissing far below. Harem shows with an original approach will beat mainstream harems built around magical high schools or battle tournaments every time.

Anyway, we're out of the woods on "hard recommends." Here's the easier stuff.

###8. Gate: And Thus the JSDF Fought There
######...Or just call it "Gate"

Speaking of Harems with an original approach, in comes Gate for creating a whole universe to justify its harem. As a military otaku's self-insert fantasy, the approach was less "main character hooks up with fantasy babes" and more "Analysis of the politics of the Japanese government's occupation of a foreign power in a fantasy world."

Gate's explosion of popularity is often explained by stupid bloggers (like myself) as the renewed Japanese sentiment of once again becoming a self-reliant military power rather than completely embracing pacifism in any form. Gate flagrantly rejects complete pacifism because of the risk of a magic portal to a fantasy world opening in the middle of Akihibara. They also unironically consider walling the gate off, ultimately deciding against it and instead sending in the military. Should've made the fantasy land pay for the wall.

The light novel it's based on is rather old (2010), and several books long. A deference is given to the author's world-building, as you'll find yourself deep in the politics of leaders in the fantasy world. You'll be treated to Knight Pina Co Lada's plight of making peace with the Japanese, and the character WHO IS LITERALLY NAMED "GENERAL GENE DURAN" seeking to do just the opposite (and failing, miserably).

They managed to cram two entire seasons into the past year, and frankly, that's not even a dent in the world that is Gate. The anime can hardly do the high fantasy in the light novels justice, but it certainly does try. If the characters don't interest you, the world might. If the world doesn't, well, now you know the quality of the anime I'm dealing with. Gate gets the 8-spot for trying to do what Re:Zero this season is ultimately succeeding at here in 2016.

###7. Yuri Kuma Arashi
######"Lily Bear Storm" or gals bein pals

Yuri Kuma is significantly more arthouse than the anime above, filling the thematic void by telling a kaleidoscope story that allows the viewer to fill in the blanks on the message at the end. I had to watch it a second time, as watching it weekly was hard to enjoy as a complete title. I found it more disappointing the second time through, as its storytelling flaws become more pronounced. Watching Tsubaki run up the stairs of a tower is more palatable when given a week's time. Otherwise, it's repetitive.

There's still significant intrigue in the characters and art to enjoy this show. The color palette is a mix of darker tones contrasted with the brighter ones of the characters. It may not animate much toward the end, but most of the first 8 episodes will have plenty to show. The use of 3D is a bit misplaced and inappropriate at times, but the rest you'll hardly notice. As a purely artistic piece, Yuri Kuma does well.

The rest is simply difficult to relate to, or just end up disgusted with the main heroine who suffers from the most convenient form of amnesia.

###6. Hibike Euphonium
######"Sound! Euphonium"
There are very few things that make me wax nostalgia about band as hard as this show did. If Kids on the Slope reminded me of my entire time playing piano, Hibike exclusively reminded me of high school band. This is a first on a list of easy recommends, with a constant kaleidoscope of color and sound.

There was a moment where I thought it'd be some kind of progressive look at female relationships, and push an agenda. Thank god it didn't, honestly. It was more about the real high school drama that happens in the marching band, something I related to almost too much. Of extreme particular interest is the relationship between the band and the conductor.

My high school band went through 3 different conductors, first one was a veteran who had been there forever, the second was straight out of college, and the third didn't even get his degree in music. The fairness this series took to approaching the band makes this an easy recommend to students of their high school music program, and the conductors themselves.
