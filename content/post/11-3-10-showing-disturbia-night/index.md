Yo, all. It’s Grant again. By now, I’m sure you all know the drill. Last night we watched Dai Mahou Touge (1-4), Shiki (1-4), and Narutaru (1-3). Thoughts go below!

I thought Dai Mahou Touge was hilarious. I’m sure it would have been 100x better with working sound, but I still managed to enjoy this show. The story wasn’t anything special, but it’s obviously not meant to be a show you watch for the story. Despite the brutal situations that the characters get into, the show manages to still be incredibly funny. I can see why this was chosen for Disturbia night, as it was definitely a ‘wtf’ sort of anime all around. I don’t know if I’ll finish it, but I wouldn’t mind seeing more.

Shiki I was looking forward to because everyone who’s seen it never fails to mention how awesome it is. Maybe this put a little bit too much expectation in me, though. I mean, I enjoyed Shiki, and I definitely want to finish it so I can see what it’s all about, but I don’t think I got the ‘awesome’ vibe that I was meant to. Maybe we can just chalk it up to the lack of sound. I do think being able to actually hear, say, the background music in the 4th episode improved things a lot, so I’ll probably rewatch it from start to finish once the show is finished (I dislike waiting, see). I feel like I can’t give a very qualified opinion yet; I just know I want to see the rest.

Narutaru was also… interesting. I keep hearing how messed up it is–especially the manga–so I grabbed both the anime and the manga and will probably get to those sometime. I did find the more realistic(?) approach to the monster formula pretty refreshing, too, and I was surprised at some of the content, even though I was understandably expecting some pretty mature stuff considering what I had heard. I will be finishing the show for sure, and I’ll probably get through the manga, too. It seems worth a watch, and I can see myself doing a post on it in the future.

And that’s all I have to say about that. Feel free to discuss!
