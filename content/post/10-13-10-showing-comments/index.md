Hey guys! Me again, just posting about tonight’s showing, because for some reason I’m not asleep yet. This will probably be a shorter post, since I just want to put out some general thoughts, as opposed to going over all of what I thought of every show. And then I suppose others can just jump in an make comments, supposing you don’t want to make your own topic about it.

To recap, we saw the last three episodes of Arakawa Under the Bridge, Black Rock Shooter (OVA), Cat Shit One (OVA), and three episodes of The Legend of Koizumi (OVA).

First, for Arakawa, I actually felt… rather disappointed. I didn’t expect it to come to some big conclusion or anything, but it felt wrong that the last three episodes more or less felt like the rest of the episodes in the season, as opposed to building up to something satisfying. I mean, the show is still funny, and I look forward to the second season, but I would be lying if I said I was completely happy with the way the season ended. Maybe I’m just picky–and I know this is just a straight up comedy show–but I feel like it should have reached some sort of fulfilling end. The relationship between Ko and his father still feels basically as estranged as it always was, so I can’t help feeling disappointed.

Black Rock Shooter was pretty great, though. I mean, it’s also kind of confusing. I had seen it prior to tonight’s showing, but it was still understandably enjoyable. I suppose the general idea is simple enough (multiple worlds, persona, etc.?), but it’s still pretty intriguing. I believe Gene said it’s supposed to have something to do with a movie being made? If that’s true, then it’s safe to say I’m rather stoked for the film. The OVA is pretty interesting, so a movie would be great.

Cat Shit One was, indeed, also awesome. I mean, it’s pretty standard in that it’s people-with-the-odds-stacked-up-against-them-end-up-winning-because-they’re-awesome but it’s obviously _not-so-standard_ in that it’s populated by bunnies and camels shooting each other–in three dimensions, no less, with incredibly smooth animation. All-in-all, a very cool little OVA, though it also felt a little bit like it was just an excuse for the animators to show off their skills, since I don’t think anyone would say there was much substantial to it. Nonetheless, very cool!

Legend of Koizumi was amazing and hilarious. I don’t know much about Mahjong, so I feel like I’m still missing some things, but I get the general idea of satire in politicians playing Mahjong to decide world rule. It’s way over-the-top and just kind of awesome. I think I will definitely look into the Manga to see what other stuff the badass Koizumi and co. get up to. I imagine it ends in more Rising Suns and whatnot, but it still seems pretty great. I don’t think there could have been a cooler faceoff with Mao ever.

…And that’s basically all I have to say about the showing. Overall I enjoyed it very much–there’s nothing I would point out as me having disliked, so I call success.

With that said, I should be off to bed. Night, guys!
