Apparently at our first showing we had Ranma 1/2 and some other shows. The second showing was a sketchy fansubber VHS with Yaoi hentai. Apparently the presidents then had just as bad taste as the ones today. Being in an anime club is suffering.

Anyway, we might have a guest in the coming weeks, we’ll see. Updates on this story later as it develops.
