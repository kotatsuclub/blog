‘Sup, guys! Just Grant again, creating a post about last night’s showing since no one else has done so, yet. As a reminder, the shows we watched for zombie night were Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei followed by High School of the Dead, and we ended with two episodes of Hellsing Ultimate, the OVA.

Like usual, I’ll just give a few of my own comments on each of the shows, and then it’ll be open from there for anyone who’s interested. Here we go!

It’s hard for me to find much to say about Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei. This is probably because we watched so little of it, and I had a problem figuring out what was going on. The unfortunate skipping problem that we had made it almost unwatchable for me, actually, but it was still pretty funny at times. I’d like to revisit this anime sometime to get a better idea of what it’s about. It looks to be some form of satire show, but I really haven’t seen enough to say. Only one part of it may have been appropriate for zombie night, but that’s okay!

The second show we watched was High School of the Dead. I’ve already made a pseudo-review of it [here.](http://minesblog.com/anime/2010/10/11/review-2-review-harder/#more-175) My general thoughts on the show basically go like this: I like it and I think it’s a good show, but there’s too damn much fanservice. An obvious choice for zombie night, though, right?

Lastly was Hellsing Ultimate. First I should just say that I dislike Hellsing. I don’t know why. I can’t rationalize my distaste for this series. I just don’t like it. I’ve tried to enjoy it, though, trust me. This was my third time watching the first two episodes of the OVA, and I’ve read a few volumes of the manga, but for some reason I just can’t get into it. It could be the art, or the names, or the general feel of ‘pretension’ I get from the show (which must sound weird coming from an Eva fan), but I have no idea why it holds so many people in thrall. I guess if you enjoy it, more power to you, but it just isn’t my thing.

Overall I think it was a great showing, though, even though the first slot was full of skipping/volume problems and the third slot was plagued with Hellsing. I also liked the AMV that Matt started off with. I had actually seen it before in an AMV contest at Anime Expo 2010 in Los Angeles this past summer, and it was a real crowd pleaser there, so I hope I wasn’t the only one that enjoyed it. I know nothing about Soul Eater, though.

And that’s all from me! See you guys next week.
