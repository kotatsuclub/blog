            "Content": "Hey, I play rhythm games a lot myself. My favorite is Beat Mania series, although, to be honest, I‚Äôve never played Beat Mania. There is a Korean game called EZ2DJ, and they are very similar, and Konami actually sued the Korean company, so they can‚Äôt make EZ2DJ anymore. Anyway, EZ2DJ is the one I played a lot. It‚Äôs focused more on the 5-key mode, while Beat Mania mostly uses 7-key mode, and EZ2DJ has pedal, which is, or was, totally new. After suing the Korean company, Konami decided to put pedals on Beat Mania. Those bastards‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see why they aren‚Äôt suing Guitar Hero and Rock Band, which are just complete rip off of Konami‚Äôs Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania (and now Keyboard Mania since Rock Band 3).\n\nSadly, I haven‚Äôt played anything Beat Mania style, so I got quite bad. But I started playing new rhythm game called osu! (all lower case with ! at the end) and it‚Äôs pretty good. It‚Äôs basically Elite Beat Agent but people can make ‚Äúmaps‚Äù which are musics. It also has two special mode, which include Taiko mode, and since it‚Äôs from Konami, it may be sued soon. I hope not, though‚Ä¶.",

I‚Äôm rather horrible at mathematics and it just goes without saying that I can‚Äôt play rhythm games as well as you‚Ä¶ I have played a handful, though, including osu! and some Rock Band (even though I know this rather pales in difficulty when compared to, say, ANY OTHER RHYTHM GAME EVER) and DJ Hero.\n\nI used to own DDRMax2 for the PS2, but I never got beyond Light difficulty for that. Would be fun to get back into it, but hey. I also still have to try both BeatMania and Stepmania still, bahh. You can tell I‚Äôm not too on the up-and-up with these things.\n\nAnyway, good to sort-of make your acquaintance, Daniel.
