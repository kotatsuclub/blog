Hello, everyone!  I’m Daniel, your, uh, media officer (at least, I think that’s what I am…).  宜しくお願いします。(I don’t know much Japanese, only one semester’s worth and a bit more that I’ve learned on my own.  (I know kanji pretty well though.))

So, by now, you’re probably wondering what exactly the media officer does.  That’s a good question; I’m wondering the same thing.  Well, you, uh, you know, just like [Gene! Give me something to do so I can finish the sentence-] uh…  Seriously though Gene, you can give the media officer something to do for the club.  I mean, I’m busy, but I can always find time for anything.

Well now that you know how intense the job of media officer is, you’re probably wondering why I embarked on the long and difficult journey to become the _media officer_ **.** The answer is quite simple.  I. Love. Anime.  I would give anything to further the cause…[/sarcasm off]  Actually, I don’t even watch that much anime, and if you were to ask me whether or not I like anime, being my extremely un-opinionated self, I’d only be able to answer “Yeah, I guess so…”.  I guess it was just that the club had 1 president and no officers, so when the time came to stand up, make a difference, change the world!  I stood up, walked to the front of the room, and became the _Media Officer_.  (oops, I think I just wrote too over-dramatically again…)

Since you now know exactly what the media officer does and how and why I became the media officer, I guess now I should tell you a bit about myself.  Well, it’s not like my life is that interesting.  I learn new things pretty easily, I’m good at math and programming and such, and I play videogames.  I’m not very talkative, but if you want to discuss the inverse of 2^(2^x)+2^x and why it might solve the logistic equation, or if you want to talk about where the shroom on Toad’s Factory should be used and why the standard shortcut and the end of the box area would be the best places, maybe you could start up a conversation.  I guess I can probably be kind of indecisive sometimes too, maybe.  But in the end, maybe the description from my YouTube channel sums it up all right:

“I want to accomplish the ‘impossible’, do something truly amazing, pull off some kind of miracle. I always dream big and I do my best to… do my best.

I never disrespect.”

If you’re wondering about the kinds of games I usually play, feel free to check out [my channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/DdRMaSTeRDan).  I play a lot of Mario Kart Wii, and also DDR and other rhythm games.  (You can also find a few non-gaming related videos in there: [created music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XGAh2dT4Ng)/ [created programs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvzaH39NpPM).)

Well, that’s the media officer position, and the media officer, the person, in a nutshell.  And… that’s all for this post.  Until next time–!
