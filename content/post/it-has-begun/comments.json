Or if they were holding hands. Or if they looked cuter. Or if they… you know what? They are just not my type. I’d rather have Cure White.\n\nNo, seriously. I liked her even before there were 19 other Precures. (since Cure Black came out at the same time) I just didn’t tell anyone because I really haven’t watched the show, and I feared people might not understand me. But after seeing Gene like that, I finally have enough courage to say it.\n\nAnd I thought I should link this.
