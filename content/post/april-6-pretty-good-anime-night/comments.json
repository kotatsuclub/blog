            "Content": "Damn, I canâ€™t believe I never explained the rage.\n\nAnyway, Steve was complaining about the fact that there are in fact 4 laws of robotics if you include the 0â€²th law: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. Anyway, that was part 1 of the rage.\n\nPersonally, I found it frustrating how distrustful everyone was of robots, even up until the end. But hey, it all gets resolved in the end anyway.\n\nAlso, hi Grant! Howâ€™s vacation?",

Ah, well, I guess the story makes more sense when societyâ€™s painted with a little negativity.\n\nAnyway, hey, Gene! Vacationâ€™s nice. Twenty-six days until AX. Is your field session over?",
