I would offer distinguishing characteristics about myself to jog memory or something, but I can’t think of anything…\n\nI completely agree about Sugita Tomokazu, though. Kyon is probably my favorite part of the Haruhi series, and it’s probably because Sugita is so great. I mean, not that I can actually judge, since I don’t understand Japanese, but he feels very right for the kind of character Kyon is.\n\nI had no idea he was Ragna and Star, though. I’m surprised I never noticed. Pretty neat stuff. It kind of makes a lot of sense, too.\n\nAnyway, I’m sure I’ll see you around!"
