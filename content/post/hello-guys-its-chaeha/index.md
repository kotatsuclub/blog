[Before I start, sorry, I don't know how to make it so that only parts are showing before clicking the title. I don't want to take whole page, so someone please tell me.]

I just had a very sad thing, but being able to write here makes me happy, so I’m half okay, I guess.

(I’d rather not remember it, so I buried it deep in my heart. That’s how sad I am.)

Anyway, I should introduce myself first.

My name is Chaeha Park. I’m from Korea, and I’ve been here (US) for only 4 years, so my English is still not really good. Well, I started learning English when I was a 4th grader–for me, it was required class at 4th grade, but I think even kindergarteners are learning English nowadays, although I strongly oppose that–but it was more like alphabet class than English class.

One of my hobbies involving anime is, as you may know already, looking up voice actors and actresses while I watch anime. Yes, I just can’t wait until the anime ends. I’ll probably forget which character I wanted to know by then.

So, I am a self-acclaimed seiyuu(voice actor/actress) otaku. But in truth, I didn’t really care about them until very recently, so if a real seiyuu otaku sees me, he/she may get mad at me. But I can say this. Now I do care, and my knowledge base is getting bigger every second!

That’s why I am going to tell you about voice actors and actresses, possibly make connections to shows we watch in one meeting, or just general comments about them (this means I’m fan of that particular person. If you are not, then just get over it.)

It’s my first post, so I’ll keep it simple. I think…….

So, we watched Haruhi movie and Arakawa last time, so I’ll do those two. By the way, I loved the movie, but not the quality. I understand you couldn’t wait for it to be released, Gene, but it was horrible. It made me think that I’d rather wanna watch Hahiru! (Well, not really. If you don’t know what that is, it’s probably better for you. And if, for some reason, you DO know what it is, I’m sorry. And please understand I didn’t watch it, never will, and I’m just using the it as a joke. Really. I’m not the kind of person who’d watch that kind of stuff!)

Well, anyway, let’s start out with one of my favorite actor in Suzumiya, Sugita Tomokazu.(I’ll write last name first.)

I don’t know why he’s doing that, so if you do, please tell me.

So, he voiced Kyon.

Umm……

Sorry, I mean this Kyon.

There’s a a funny story about his name. When Haruhi light novels were published in Korea, MS word and stuff like that used some kind of system called EUC-KR. I don’t really know what it is, but apparently, it just saves common Korean characters in order. (I don’t know if I’m making any sense here, but Korean characters are commonly  made of 2 to 3 letters. But there are characters that require more.)

BUT! “Kyon” was not registered in EUC-KR, so they couldn’t type it. Basically, it was typed as “K Yo N” instead of just “Kyon.” So, what they made “Kyon” as an image file, and pasted it after printing. By the way, now they use something else, so it’s okay. “쿈” is “Kyon” in Korean, but what they got before was “ㅋㅛㄴ”

That was longer than I thought. Well, He was the Star in Arakawa. If you see those two, you’d think that he does gag characters, right? I mean, he does them quite well, but he did all sorts of characters. When I was looking it up, I was actually surprised.

He did Lonove form Umineko, Subaru from X, He or That Man or whatever he’s called in Guilty Gear 2 Overture, Ragna from BlazBlu, and so on.

He is also a video game otaku. He plays as Ragna when he plays BlazBlu, and people say he’s good.

Well, it turned out to be only about Sugita, but like I said, I’m a fan. There was no connection between Arakawa and Haruhi anyway. Except that Goto Yuko (Asahina Mikuru) played someone(or possibly something I don’t really know what it is…) called Jacklin or something in Arakawa, but I don’t think we’ve seen that yet.

Well, it’s my first post. So it will be unorganized and all that, but hopefully it will be better.

That’s all I have to say for now. Until next showing, then. I hope we watch BRS, because Hanazawa Kana, my absolute favorite, is BRS. I can never get tired of her voice.
