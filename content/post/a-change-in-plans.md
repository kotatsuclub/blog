So, here's the deal: after I put up my next review, the plan was for me to take next Wednesday off and enjoy the good long weekend for fall break. I mean, hey, the new season is out and I've got to be on the ball in that respect, so it seemed like an excellent excuse. That plan, unfortunately did not account for the amount of schoolwork that I had to handle this week, and regrettably that means my initial plan sunk.

That said, I do want to make sure I don't stiff you guys out of a review just because I couldn't keep my schedule organized, so here's what we're doing. I'm taking this week off instead, and next week I'll put up the review that was supposed to go up today. Pretty much, we're just flipping my vacation a bit to help me get caught up with school and make sure I'm not distracted by anything major going into my reviews.

Sound like a deal?

Thanks for your patience, and see you next week!
