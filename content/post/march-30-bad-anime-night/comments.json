            "Content": "Freezing is laughably bad, and might be watchable for the lulz. I only made it to Episode 2 on my own, though, and I don’t expect to get any farther. I’ve heard that the anime is pretty much nothing at all like the manga from various sources; maybe I’ll check that out sometime.\n\nSamurai Girls was…umm. Somewhere, a Japanese historian is crying loudly. All of the legendary samurai and ninja of Japanese history…made into female high school students and placed into a harem. Seriously? I guess it’s just light-hearted comedy, but still.\n\nWatching Garzey’s Wing gave me a brain tumor that I had to zap with 3 hours of Madoka. I watched part of it a while ago with Gene, and I think it speaks for itself. It’s basically universally acclaimed to be the worst thing ever, and there’s not a lot of opinions anime fans will unite over. I have to wonder how many times the voice actors had to reread their lines to say them with a relatively straight face. I want to say that it was all a joke, and that the dub was a troll dub, but…I don’t know.\n\n6 cans of cheap soda and 300g of sugar FTW. Still almost fell asleep in Garzey’s Wing until I got distracted by OreImo Strip Breakout on Chaeha’s PSP. Speaking of which, was really good to see Alex again. The products and pictures he brought back were ridiculously awesome."
