            "Content": "First of all, it’s こんばんは, not こんばんわ. I understand since は end わ can be confusing. If I remember corectly, こんばんは is form こんばんは どうですか, which could meen “how to you feel tonight,” and only “tonight” part survived since Japanese people likes to shorten words.\n\nAnd second, it’s みなさん, nor みんなさん. You can use みんな as itself, but not wit さん. Or you cab also use 皆さん, if you want some kanji. I thin みんなさん is moe like “every-one-body.”\n\nMan, I think I maybe starting to like doing this kinda of tsukkomi on Steve’s post. You know what, I was pondering for about 10 minuets before posting connnents weather I should post is or not.",
