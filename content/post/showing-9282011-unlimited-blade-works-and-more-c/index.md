Obligatory because we’re showing it.  Read [Matt’s review](http://minesblog.com/anime/2011/09/22/it-has-begun/) if you want to see what happened last week.  Come get schooled in some econ.

**Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works**

In stark contrast to last week’s movie (I’m still recovering from that aneurysm Gene) and in preparation for Fate/Zero beginning THIS SUNDAY (10/2), this week’s movie is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works.  For those who have seen the original Fate/Stay Night anime, this is an alternate route taken from the visual novel.

Once every 10 years, seven magi engage in a war for the Holy Grail.  In order to aid the magi in this pursuit, each mage summons the spirit of a warrior to fight for them.  The magi fight to eliminate each other from the search for the Holy Grail.  The last one standing (or alive) wins.

This movie has some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen, and to make sure nothing is lost at this showing, we’ll be showing UBW in GLORIOUS 1080P WITH FLAC AUDIO.  Which means that you too can get access to this amazing movie to share and amaze your friends with when you become a CSM Anime Club member today!

Stick around after Unlimited Blade Works for a special OVA presentation from the universe of Type Moon; sure to be appropriate and consistent with the mood following UBW.

As always, member dues are $2 for the semester and get you access to the over 3 TB of anime in the club library and also pay for pizza and soda for select showings.  We still have Ramune and are still selling it for $1.50.  Support your anime club so we can continue to put on great showings!

We’ll see you all Wednesday, bring your friends!
