The other name, obviously, is

# Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Boku Tachi wa Mada Shiranai

Which translates to “We Still do not Know the Name of the Flower we Saw that Day” which we then shorten to “Ano Hana” which translates to “dat flower.” Here’s a graph illustrating how little sense this makes:

In the midst of my boredom from studying I took it upon myself to check out some of the other anime that aren’t Deadman Wonderland or Steins;Gate this season. Everything else was basically irrelevant (C and wow that also has a really long title), too close to home (health and education for 30-year-olds), or too cliche to be worth the effort (Hidan no Aria, Astralotte’s toy, Ao no Exorcist…). The other stuff I didn’t have time for, and as much as I would like to catch up on Kaiji, it’s a pretty slow-moving anime anyway and I think it’ll be fine if I let it get through some of the 26 episodes it needs to finish.

Back on topic, DAT FLOWER B) is a fun show for all the wrong reasons. First of all, the main character is trippin’ balls. It’s fun to imagine what his dumb ass looks like to someone outside looking in, seeing as this girl he’s hallucinating can still somehow interact with him but no one else. As a result, he gets a lot of strange looks from passers-by and a lot of people pick up his glasses for him. This girl, by the way, was his childhood friend who died in some sort of terrible accident, and now – as a result of being a stressed-out hikikimori – he talks to her ghost and is a big dick to girls.

Speaking of sexism, there’s a lot of it in this show. Not only that, it’s the unintentionally funny kind of sexism that makes watching any other anime just as fun. The ghost makes these terrible muffins at one point while he’s busy not being at school. When he gives these to his friends, he later gets criticisms from – guess who – another girl who tells him that he should’ve used some baking soda.

There are some other things I think are hilarious about this show, but that will screw up the show for most of you down the line. Funny show, I’m interested to see where it goes. I’ll probably finish it because I already passed the 3-episode drop zone. Hope you all have a wonderful summer. If you need me, I’ll be at fiji until the 20th.

PS: The Freezing OVAs sucked but still managed to be better than the rest of the show itself.
