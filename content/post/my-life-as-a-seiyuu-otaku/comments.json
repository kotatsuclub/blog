I don’t think it’s word to word translation, but the general theme is same.\n\nI think next time I go to karaoke, I’m gonna sing all the Korean OP’s of my childhood. On top of my head, Card Captor Sakura, Rayearth, Saint Tail, Eto Ranger, and maybe more.\n\nMan, I wish I could go back to that time."
