Hey, everyone! It’s time for another semester at the happiest place on earth, the Colorado School of Mines. For the new Freshman types that don’t know me, I’m Grant Walker, a Sophomore in Computer Science. I’m also not too bright, but you’ll figure that out as we go. Anyway, since last year, I’ve typically been posting my opinion on the anime we see each night, because everyone cares about my opinion.

Anyway, for this showing we watched Nichijou, and those who stayed for a while after also got a peek at Carnival Phantasm, which I’m not going to talk about because I believe Gene said he wanted to show it later, too. But anyway…

**Nichijou**

So Nichijou was a pretty basic show. It was a slice-of-life kind of anime taking place in a world that’s only a wee bit different from ours, where eight-year-old prodigies can develop fully sentient and rather-human robuts.

It’s hard for me to think of what to say about this show. It is a slice of life, after all, which often don’t have much you can say about them in the first place. At least the animation was pretty good, but since it’s KyoAni they don’t get any points for it.

The first episode was kind of funny (I particularly enjoyed the entire wiener skit) but past the first episode most of the comedy seemed kind of inane. I feel like this show would be better if you just watched it the way it was released–maybe one episode a week, tops. There’s just too much nonsense and, once you grow accustomed to it, a lot of the jokes stop being as funny, so I feel like smaller doses would be a better way to take this show.

Anyway, it looks like this is going to be one of the shorter posts I have… which makes sense, since there was only one show.

At any rate, here’s to a good rest of the year with you guys! I’m looking forward to my weekly reprieves from girlfriends and schoolwork.

See you next week!
