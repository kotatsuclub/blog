So Iâ€™ve gotten pretty good at doing the combo challenges on Blazblue Continuum Shift. Â Hereâ€™s three videos on it: [Tager](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fa-kCXXTmc), [Tsubaki](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIoRCoekE0E), and [Tsubaki no screen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Dy3tagld4). Â To be honest, I was surprised I could do the combos without the screen on. Â That doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m any good though; my experience playing against human players isâ€¦ 3 Xbox live battles and playing my brother. Â Then score attack practice: I beat it with Tager fairly, then someone told me about pressing start on a 2nd controller, and I used that to beat it with Lambda and Mu. Â Anyway, if you play me and I close my eyes in the middle of combos, youâ€™ll know why. ðŸ˜‰
