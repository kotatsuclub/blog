Wow, I should post or something. I have been spending all my free time trying to learn more Japanese so I can talk to people. Its so strange living in a place where you can’t read anything; stupid kanji.  Well due to one request I’m going to dump some images on where I’m staying. Also, a few of the school.

However, next weekend I’ll be going to Akihabara and will troll some otaku.

Here the one of the hallways in the dorm during the day.   Japan has a lot better focus on both recycling and energy conservation then america. So, dorm is constantly dark during the day, and constantly about 50°F.  Each dorm room has its own AC/heater unit so its nice and warm in my room.

I have a single dorm room which is quite small. The dorm is half double rooms and have single rooms. Both are about the same size.  But still much nicer then my room in Weaver Towers back at mines my freshman year.

Here are a couple pictures of the kitchens for the single and double sides of the dorm. All the students share these and have to keep them clean. With all the time I spend studying I usually end up buying bento or pan.  I personally would have preferred to have some sort of meal plan. Which you can kinda get by doing a home-stay where you live at a Japanese family’s house.   From the people I have talked to who are doing it they say that the food is awesome.  However the downside is that its more exspensive then staying in the dorm. Anyway 400 円 bentos are way better then anything you can get in America when it comes to cheap Japanese food.

This Is one of the common rooms.   Most people seem to hang out in their rooms being boring and watching anime.

This is a picture of one of the school buildings:

That is a picture of the building I have classes in. It used to be a factory but the insides look a lot more like a school.

The program I’m doing is focused on mostly spoken Japanese. I have 5hrs of class per day and usually spend the rest of the day doing homework or studying more vocabulary.  As always there are a lot more  pictures on my Facebook [page](http://www.facebook.com/people/Alex-Osecky/100000118307995).

That’s all for what the school/dorm is like.   Next weekend Akihabara.  Hmm what should I say to the otaku to troll them? Insult their waifu? O, the possibilities are endless.   Also, I need suggestions on what to buy. I hope what ever I buy can get past US customs.
