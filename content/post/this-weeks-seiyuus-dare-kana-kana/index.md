If you thought I was going to do Rena’s seiyuu, sorry, but you’re wrong.

This week’s article’s going to be actually about Hanazawa Kana and Asumi Kana, hence the title. (Sorry, I’m not a fun person…)

So, the reason I chose those two is because of Black Rock Shooter at today’s showing. Hanazawa-san (she’s older than me, so gotta show some respect. I feel bad for not doing this for Sugita-san, but my thoughts didn’t go that far last time.) played Kuroi Mato, and Asumi-san played Yuu. So, since they are both in it, I’ll do both of them, right?

Oh, and Maria from Arakawa and Yomi from Black Rock Shooter also shares seiyuu.

I’ll start with Asumi-san first, because I like Hanazawa-san a lot more, and I’m one of those who saves things they like at the end.

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/f0007940_4bd2c58074e65.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/f0007940_4bd2c58074e65.jpg" width="640" height="426">}}So, Asumi-san is one on the right. The one on the left is Shintani Ryoko-san, and if I get the chance, maybe I’ll write about her. As you may recognize her costume, she played Miya from Amagami SS.

Her voice is either calm and cute, or mischievous, like Miya. She is somewhat shy when it comes to romance, and whenever romance comes up in her radio program, she gets really quiet. Her “date” is going to a theme park and having a soft ice cream together… And here I thought I was shy.

So, some of her roles are: Miya from Amagami, Kondo Mikoto from Kämpfer, Irie from Angel Beats!, Hyouka from A Certain Magical Index, Ushiro Kana from Bokurano, and of course Yuu from Black Rock Shooter. Honestly, I haven’t seen many of the show she’s in. And I don’t really have so much to say about her. Hmm…. now I think there was no point doing this…

Now, for Hanazawa-san. I don’t know when, but now I’m such a fan. I just love her quiet voice. My first experience of her voice was in Angel Beats! I liked her voice so much, and tried to watch shows she’s in ever since.

As a fan, I new that she was playing Kuroneko from Oreimo, and while I was watching the second episode, I saw her character. So, I was like, “say something. Come on say something, damn it.” the whole time until she said something.

She started acting career early as a child actress and started voice acting at 2003 in Last Exile.

I’ve started watching Otome Youkai Zakuro just because of her. And it was kind of funny because many of her characters I know are:

Tachibana Kanade, loli, Kuroi Mato, somewhat loli, Kuroneko, loli, Cleo, lo… not-so-loli but 12-year-old kid, but, Susukihotaru is not that young girl.

Anyway, she’s in:

Oreimo as Kuroneko, Bungaku Shoujo as Touko, Break Blade as Cleo (the 12-year-old girl full of PLOT), Zakuro as Susukihotaru, Angel Beats! as Kanade, and Black Rock Shooter as Mato.

She was also in Bakemonogatari, Strike Witches, World God Only Knows, Kannagi, Kobato, To-Love-Ru, Kaicho wa Maid Sama!, and B Gata H Kei, and many more.

Also, in Amagami SS 14th episode, you see this librarian with two pigtails. Umehara says something about her being a “bingaku shoujo.”

That’s her. Hanazawa-san even did the voice. I knew it! Well, I had a feeling that it was her, but I found out for sure now.

Well, that’s all I got for now. Thank you for listening to my rambling about both Kana-sans. I’ll put a link to two videos about Hanazawa-san. She did a school uniform ad! I guess I am a big fan. It seems like that Asumi-san is here just because her first name is same as Hanazawa-san… I feel suddenly sad, but that’s what you get for causing such troubles to Mato, Yuu!
