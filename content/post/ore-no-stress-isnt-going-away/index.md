And neither is this blog, even though we’re out of showings. You didn’t seriously think we’d leave you in peace all summer, did you?

Finals are over and school is done, but it’s like my life didn’t get any easier. Thanks to all of my procrastination of procrastination, all of that “I’ll do it over summer” is now catching up. So much anime to watch, so many games to play, and so many miscellaneous things to waste time on. This happens every summer, and I never finish everything, and then I push it all to next summer. It’s like some kind of endless loop, or something.

Not to mention that dreaded time of the season is here. 3 episodes of most all anime this season are now out, and you know what that means. **Decisions.** Oh god, what to watch, what to drop, what to put off till later? Well, this season, I played it a bit smarter and picked out shows I thought I might enjoy beforehand instead of blindly watching everything. And here’s what I ended up with:

## Watching

_Deadman Wonderland:_ This show’s been pretty awesome so far. Death and plots and explosions and G-cups. This is probably the show I’m most excited for every week.

_Steins;Gate:_ Besides a good plot and loltimetravel, the characters are quite refreshing. There’s a good balance of comedy and plot.

_Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko:_ Despite its wacky harem-ish slice-of-lifeness, this show’s got a certain charm that draws me in. What can I say? Gotta trust that instinct.

_Ano Hana cnferjmcjukkjsaj:_ Even if sometimes I feel like I’m watching this show for the wrong reasons (see Gene’s post on the matter), I’m still intrigued. It’s slice of life, but it’s not harem, and it lacks that old tired feeling most other SoL fall prey to. Not to mention that it doesn’t really take place at school, and it can’t be all that bad.

_Hanasaku Iroha_: Like AnoHana, it’s SoL but not bad SoL. The characters are interesting and look like they’ll develop (not like _that_). There’s not too much fanservice either (other than _that_ scene), which is always a bonus.

_TWGOK S2_: Continued from last season. Sure, it’s harem-y and cliche, but it makes me laugh, which is a good thing.

_Kaiji S2:_ Also continued from last season. For all its dramatic tension, though, it’s pretty slow, and I might fall behind. Will I be able to keep up with it? No one knows. Zawa zawa

## On Hold

_C: Money of blah blah:_ I dunno. It looks interesting, but I can’t shake the feeling it’s just glorified Pokemon with credit cards. Relegated to Winter for now.

_Nichijou:_ I usually like KyoAni stuff, and I liked _Lucky Star_ and _Azumanga Daioh_, but…I don’t know. Somehow, it’s just not resonating with me. Maybe it’s because the wackiness is in the setting, and not the characters (which is why I liked the two aforementioned series). I can totally see why others would love it, though, and I plan to give it another chance later.

_Tiger and Bunny:_ Despite what I originally thought from the premise and pictures, this show’s not half bad. It’s funny, it’s satirical, and it doesn’t have a billion breasts. But I feel like my hands are full with what I’m following now, and T&B doesn’t grab my attention quite enough.

_30-sai no Hoken Taiiku:_ It’s really funny, and pretty short. I only watched one, though, and forgot about it. Now I feel like it’s too late to catch up. I’ll probably watch it when it’s finished.

## Dropped

_Dog Days:_ I really don’t know why I even bothered to watch one episode of this, let alone two. This show is terrible. Loads of fanservice, an annoying lead, a pretty idiotic premise, and no real direction. Kinda reminds me of _Zero no Tsukaima_, but with even less substance. I’m not even gonna bother with the third episode unless someone breaks down my door and threatens me with a shotgun.

_Hidan no Aria:_ I honestly thought this show might be kinda good, even though it was JC Staff + KugiRie. I really wanted it to be kinda good, because I like watching at least one stupid show a season so I can relax and not worry about it grabbing it every week on time. But after 4 episodes, it’s just getting worse, and I can’t bring myself to watch any more. The premise is old and poorly done, the characters are one-dimensional and annoying, and the srsbzns is facepalm-worthy. Tragic backstory and dramatic revelations and so steeped in BS, it’s actually pissing me off. I hereby wash my hands of this garbage.

I wonder why the more I dislike a show, the more I have to say about it. Maybe that says something about me.

Think my taste is awesome/horrible as usual? Passionately agree or vehemently disagree in the comments below! And tell us your summer plans (or lack thereof) in the meantime.
