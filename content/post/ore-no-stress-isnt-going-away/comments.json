The EE one is boring, but weâ€™ll see.\n\nBasically my list is exactly the same, except I havenâ€™t been keeping up with denpa onna due to this or that. I plan on spending my weekends practicing piano at the Ford building, I need to practice more as well. Did you get those Japanese books off the drive that Alex put on there? Theyâ€™re pretty good. I also have Danielâ€™s Japanese books that he hasnâ€™t asked for back yet so give me a holler if you feel like reading through those.\n\nLetâ€™s see, games Iâ€™m going to be playingâ€¦\n\nMass Effect (if I can ever get the steam version to work)\n\nDawn of War II (because eyeâ€™m the best at RTSes)\n\nStarcraft 2 (GOINâ€™ FOR GOLD LEAGUE!)\n\nOreImo PSP\n\nValky Chronic II \u0026 III when it comes out, cuzin Kurt has a PS3,\n\nCOH JEEP SPAM\n\nFor those that donâ€™t know, Iâ€™ll be working all summer long at an internship, feel free to bother me and ask me what Iâ€™m doing since Iâ€™ll likely be very bored out of my mind. Or, Iâ€™ll bother you all with blog posts as well.",

Iâ€™ll probably spent a lot of time trying to get good at Street Fighter 4, play Mario Kart Wii some more with some girl from Japan and some teammates from England, maybe play some other fighting games like Blazblue/Marvel vs Capcom 3â€¦ Oh yeah, I have to finish Madoka! Iâ€™ve been procrastinating on that. ðŸ˜‰ If you have any anime series you really recommend Iâ€™d watch those too. Oh, I guess Iâ€™ll be doing a little work on the 2 projects Iâ€™ll be doing next year (one in applied math and one in computer science).\n\nOh, and if you need a DDR pad, I have a plastic one for the PS2 that I donâ€™t use that you could pretty much have. Iâ€™d consider letting you borrow the foam one that can connect to the PS2 and computer (and Xbox if I can find the cord), but I do still use that one sometimes."

            "Content": "This summer will be a pretty busy one, which is unusual for me. Iâ€™m taking a summer class, directly after which Iâ€™m headed to California for Anime Expo 2011 and to catch up with my significant other (being 800 miles apart sucks).\n\nAfter that, thereâ€™s a month of watching anime and playing games until school starts. I probably wonâ€™t be as dedicated a watcher as you, though. I think the only stuff Iâ€™ll be watching is Steins;Gate and Deadman Wonderland (which I need to catch up on) unless someone can convince me to watch any of the other shows coming out.\n\nThis past week Iâ€™ve pretty much been doing nothing but Mortal Kombat 9 (lol dial-a-combos, game has no sense of timing and pisses me off, but thereâ€™s something about it) and Borderlands (old by now, but girlfriend wants me to play it!). Probably wonâ€™t be buying anything until Skyrim or Uncharted 3, and they both come out long after summer. /sigh\n\nGood luck doing all you plan to do! I hope those RB customs come along well. Itâ€™s awesome that youâ€™re looking into them.",
