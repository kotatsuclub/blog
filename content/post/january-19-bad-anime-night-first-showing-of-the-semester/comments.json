If there wasn‚Äôt so much exposition in the first couple of eps, we would‚Äôve skipped right to those. It gets off to a good start, and the satire ball does get rolling. Episode 4 is by far my favorite, with the glitchy dating sim. Then I play favorites with arcs, even if they feel a bit too strung out.\n\nTrying to finish soredemo, I got most of the way in then sort of stopped. I‚Äôve got work to do man, being anime club president is hard work! I did watch Kuragehime, if only because it got picked up by funimation. No comment there, but you can _stream_ the rest of it if you so desire.\n\nI sure do love video games. I‚Äôm glad I got to lose sleep over Amnesia again. God, pimpwalk‚Äôs a scary mofo. On a different note, everyone should try Daniel‚Äôs hard beat game. I‚Äôm the best at it, don‚Äôt let anyone (especially the creator thereof) tell you otherwise. Daniel, please continue to be awesome.",

I really liked the structure for the series where there was an arc, then an Elsie episode, then another arc, then another Elsie episode, then another arc, then Keima going God-mode.

Looking back on my top 10 list to ensure I didn‚Äôt actually claim this, I also realize I managed to mix up Aoi Yuki (who voices Tatsuno) with Chiaki Omigawa (who voices Hotori and P-ko). Derp.\n\nGod Only Knows was a fun watch. If I ever run dry on anime, I‚Äôll probably finish the rest of it (even though having more than a season‚Äôs worth of episodes usually makes me reticent to do so). Also, I am disappoint at richgirl‚Äôs kneesocks. She could have been a Grade S Zettai Ryouki if they had just added another 6-8 inches.\n\nKuragehime really banks on your liking (or at least tolerating) the setup you described. If you can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt like that (which is understandable), you probably won‚Äôt care for the rest. In case you care (spoilers) Tsukimi does _sort of_ wind up with Kuranosuke, if only because his brother gets involved in a blackmail affair with a bitchy redevelopment lady trying to earn their family‚Äôs political support after pretending to rape him. There‚Äôs a great scene with Kuranosuke pointing out to her that Shu‚Äôs a virgin and a picture of a flying unicorn popping into her head. However, the series ends before the relationship goes anywhere. Which was odd. (spoiler) Also, good point on the Game of Death/Kill Bill reference. I hadn‚Äôt remembered that, and was only reading off of tvtropes.\n\nOne more thing! For bad anime night, we should totally show Onii-chan no Koto nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!! Everyone will have a great time watching this truly awful anime. AMIRITE?",

I didn‚Äôt mean to imply you claimed Hanazawa was in Soredemo, but I guess I got confused, since Hanazawa played Tsukimi from Kuragehime, which is something you mentioned in your list. Somehow I definitely got things backwards.\n\nSo, yes: let it be known that Hotori was voiced by Chiaki Omigawa, not Hanazawa Kana. Don‚Äôt know what I was thinking there. MAH BAD GUYS.\n\nI do plan on giving Kuragehime a fair chance, so I will watch more. Parts of the concept I do like, and like I mentioned above, there were jokes and references that I thought were pretty clever. Could say kind of the same for TWGOK."

It‚Äôs clearly a easygoing slice-of-life show, and while that isn‚Äôt bad, I think I‚Äôm a bit burned out of those kinds of shows. It could be something I‚Äôd watch an episode of at a time in between episodes of other stuff coming out this season. Dunno. Might look into getting the rest of it at some point.\n\nTWGOK is something I sort of meant to watch last season after I heard it was pretty good, then forgot to. I‚Äôll probably watch it over this season when I get a chance (nabbing it now). I think it‚Äôs a pretty funny show, especially because I do the exact same thing Keima does when I watch RomCom/harem anime (‚ÄúOh, this character is x-archetype; her arc will probably go something like this‚Äù). I don‚Äôt find the characters particularly interesting, as they‚Äôre pretty vanilla (though that‚Äôs arguably the point), but it‚Äôs not bad, and it‚Äôs short.\n\nAs for Kuragehime‚Ä¶I‚Äôve got mixed feelings. It‚Äôs clearly trying to do something different from the rest of the shiny moe-centric anime around it, and that by itself somewhat intrigues me. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt know if the scenario is something I particularly enjoy. I might watch more down the road, but there‚Äôs other things I‚Äôd rather watch first.\n\nAnd while Onii-chan is definitely terrible, Gene‚Äôs right ‚Äì there‚Äôs worse. Look forward to it.",
