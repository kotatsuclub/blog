I probably said something like, “it’s not a good ending” where “good ending” is synonymous with getting the “good end” in a visual novel or something. I still liked the ending, and I love the manga to death.\n\n\\\u003enot tearing apart sword art’s awful writing\n\nI guess that’s why I need to make a list.",
