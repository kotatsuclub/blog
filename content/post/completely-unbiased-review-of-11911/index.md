I sure do enjoy the leadership here at the Colorado School of Mines anime club. They’re obviously smart, handsome, and have excellent taste in anime. After all, they wouldn’t lead the club in the first place~! (●´∀｀●)

Obviously I think Kirino is awesome if you couldn’t tell, LOL!(@ ∀@) Ore Imo was the best anime ever and I’m glad it was featured a semester ago. Too bad no anime will ever compare to it (unless they release a season 2! OLOL)

The shows we watched were Guilty Crown, Persona 4, and Bakas and Tests, Summon the Beast! (season 2). We also watched Day[9] play Amnesia! He’s so fat! I’ll be sure to give unbiased and clear reviews of each of these because no one wants to read an unfair review from some short troll with a short attention span.

# Guiltless Copyright Infringement

This show is about a mysterious girl giving an average guy super-powers to bring down the bourgeoisie. Nothing gets people riled up like an organization that hits young women fighting an evidently more appealing organization led by a bishie boy. Give me one over the other any day.

It turns out that this mysterious girl is also a minor pop star with ties to the military coup de bishounen. She gets hit a lot and orders the main character around. One thing leads to another and she ends up pointing a gun at him out of irony.

While this show excels at everything a good anime should, the plot is somewhat worrying as it takes turns that really feel like they’re supposed to be moving the plot along, but really just seem to be excuses to show more pretty art, or force some character drama, or even get the girl to sing a pretty song to put on the soundtrack. The soundtrack is mostly good, but some songs just sound silly in retrospect. Sure, it’s by supercell, but that should never mean it’s supposed to be GOOD. I’m not exactly hearing Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari over and over again.

Obvious ripoff notes aside, the show is right down the middle in terms of watchable quality. There’s a little something for everybody, but it’s certainly not for anybody. It hasn’t impressed me, at least, and I won’t be watching any more of it.

# Piss on her 4: The anime shun

A strange show about kids and a bear. The plot is just like the video game it’s based on, but for those of you who haven’t played this timeless classic RPG by Atlus, I recommend that. If you don’t feel like playing it, don’t worry, the anime is still good.

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/11/1295680348470-1024x865.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/11/1295680348470.jpg" caption="I&#39;ve been looking for a reason to post this" width="640" height="540">}}

Artistically, it’s about par for the course, but there’s really not much to complain about. The plot can feel repetitive, but there’s enough mystique to keep the viewer interested. It’s a bit like a murder-mystery monster-of-the-week hybrid shows all the cool kids are talking about.

I’m definitely biased on this one though. Good show, I’m following it.

# Idiots and Beach Episodes

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/11/zaza-1024x576.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/11/zaza.jpg" caption="zaza.... zaza...." width="640" height="360">}}

A story of a few kids going to a beach who also attend an awesome school that really needs to be hashed out more. This whole second season can feel like a giant beach episode, actually. Just watch the first season.

Unfortunately, this was cut short by…

# DAY[9]: Y U NO HAVE BRAINS

I will say this, the beginning is very much worth watching. The middle, not so much. Would’ve done better as just a drama cd.

That being said, this is the part where I listen to your inferior opinions. If you think you like better anime than I do, you should say so in the comments, you worthless ingrate. I’m not implying anything, but you likely don’t sleep with a member of the opposite sex, and don’t wash your hands for at least 10 seconds after using the restroom. Everyone else can worship me.

I hope this is enough to make you want Jack as President. I really hope so.
