# What I like

### MM!{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/superhellamasochist.png" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/superhellamasochist.png" width="847" height="480">}}

I’ve been following MM! pretty religiously these past weeks, n-not that I l-like it or anything. Actually, I DO like it. Quite a bit, actually. I don’t know if its the predictable plot twists, unoriginal character design, or low-budget art. Everything about this anime SCREAMS “awful, boring show” _ESPECIALLY_ the OP [(HERUPU YOUUU! IKUYOOO!)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN_qaAdN-_0) makes me want to fling coffee mugs at my computer monitor. Despite all of this, I’m getting sucked into the characters, enjoying the plot twists, and finding some art particularly brilliant (at least its fight scene looks better than the one in [Toradora!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR7UlM9KvCk)). I wouldn’t be ashamed of throwing this into one of our first showings next semester, which actually feels pretty bad man.

### Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteiru

Whoever said SHAFT couldn’t do a slice of life needs to check their source. I’m pretty sure SHAFT can do pretty much whatever they want, especially in their drug-induced art meetings. I could ramble on about how the maido-show does good art and storytelling, but let’s face it: you all know I’m watching it for the maid costumes and P-ko’s VA [Chiaki Omigawa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaki_Omigawa "Chiaki Omigawa") It’s pretty much the bee’s knees.

### Motto To Love-Ru

Actually I just really like the [OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSjX00lM3XM). KOTOKO does some of my favorite music. You may have heard the [Blazblue OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrMVte7EfQ0), something she recently got famous for. But in all seriousness, the show itself sucks geass.

## Strike Witches 2

Following a change of studio, a higher budget, and a blu-ray release as opposed to a DVD one, Strike Witches 2 had a noticeable jump in quality compared to the first season. That’s not it, there’s a re-done soundtrack, new characters, and a changing ED. This show is still for pedofiles and that still feels REAL bad man.

JESUS CHRIST HOW HORRIFYING.

I’ll probably be mentioning some of the good anime that’s gone bad. There may be a flamewar incoming. YOUR PRESIDENT IS AN EXPERT TROL.
