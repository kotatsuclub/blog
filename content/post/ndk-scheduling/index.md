For those who don’t know,  Nan Desu Kan is this weekend.  This post is to help schedule rides.  The schedule for the con is available [here](http://ndkdenver.org/files/ndk-2011-events-schedule.pdf).  Post in this thread if you’re going to the con!

So far, Matt, Chris, and I have space in our cars, so depending on how many responses are in this thread, we may need more people able to drive, but probably not.

If you need a ride to the event, please post your name, number of bodies in your party, times you would like to be at the con, and any special requirements you have (space for costumes, etc).
