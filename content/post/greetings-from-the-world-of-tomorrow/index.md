Yo, my name is Alex Osecky. I’m going to be doing some posting on the blog for a while. I just graduated from Mines in the fall semester with a degree in CS. As a kinda graduation trip I decided to go to japan and study Japanese.  So at least for a little while I will be posting some stuff that will probably be 100% unrelated to anime.

I took the shinkansen, bullet train, for most of the way.  It was awesome way to see how big Tokyo was and how densely packed the buildings are.

I also got to look at Mount Fuji from both sides as the shinkansen went past it.  It dwarfs the mountains around it. Quite an awesome sight.

After I took the shinkansen from Tokyo to Toyohashi I took the wrong train and spent a few hours being lost. So words of advice make sure you know where the train is going before you get on it, and make sure its going the correct direction before you spend an hour riding it.  When I finally figured out which train to be on it did not take that long for me to arrive at Okazaki.  During these two days in japan I have yet to see anything related to anime yet. Not a single advertisement anywhere so far.  In the next few days I’ll have some free time where I’m not being lost or sleep deprived where I can go find some awesome stuff.
