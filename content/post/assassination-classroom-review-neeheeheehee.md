Well, the last half of the semester was an absolute scramble on my end. I got bogged down with a ton of school stuff right on the run up to finals week, and that meant I was typing, writing, studying and doing everything I had to clear my plate just in time for the next slop of work to be dropped onto it. As it turns out, being a grad student with courses, a thesis and starting next semester a TA position is not quite the same level of work as my undergrad stuff. Who would've thought?

If there was any upside to any of this, it was that I had just enough time between meals to slip in an episode of anime here and there. *Magus' Bride* in particular I'm finding to be a really solid show this season, but I want to wait until it finishes so I can give it a full review proper because, well, it deserves it. So in the interim, I think I'll talk about the other thing I've been watching, and no we're not getting a review of *The Punisher* on this site. But seeing as how I've really been enjoying that show, I thought it'd be fitting to put on something along the same vein. And wouldn't you know it; Crunchy and Funi's slow merger resulted in them finally bringing over a sweetheart from 2015.

Yes kids, it's the wonderful saga about everyone's favorite octopus teacher and his murderous band of students: *Assassination Classroom*.
