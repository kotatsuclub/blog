It‚Äôs pretty much the only regular thing to expect on the blog so far‚Ä¶ (I had to say something else so I didn‚Äôt feel like a jerk just pointing out a mistake)",

            "Content": "Nanoha _is_ technically a seinen series, despite (or maybe because of) its mostly child cast. Fun fact: Meruru‚Äôs (and Kanako‚Äôs) VA did Nanoha. And apparently Yuuno‚Äôs VA did Mami.\n\nNanoha movie was alright (and it was a decent recap of the first season). Biggest problem I had with the original series was how they turned Precia into a complete villain at the end to make it absolutely clear she‚Äôs the most despicable person ever so we forget about her and make it easier for the animators to wrap up the plot. There was just something cheesy and forced about the way she kept telling Fate how she hated her in like 15 different ways. They added a lot more backstory in the movie (original TV series had none of Precia‚Äôs flashbacks). 1080p lazers was also good.\n\nOn an unrelated note, they‚Äôre releasing more Higurashi in celebration of its 10 year anniversary.",

                    "Content": "Since it‚Äôs you saying it, I‚Äôll believe it‚Äôs seinen, but I think a young kid could easily sit through the movie and know what was happening. It does so many things I‚Äôd expect from a kid‚Äôs show that it‚Äôs really easy to see it that way, at least from my point of view.\n\nI‚Äôm surprised to hear that the movie would have more back story, but I guess that‚Äôs cool. But yeah, even a nub like me picked up on how much Precia suddenly seemed to want Fate to realize how much she hated her. It definitely felt overdone.\n\nHigurashi is exciting news, though. Does that mean more novel chapters, or more anime?"

The beginning was so stereotypical mahou shoujo I don‚Äôt even know how to discuss it. Once the story picked up a bit and some fighting commenced though, I could not stop watching. The fights were like fucking mecha. Moar lazorz please. The fights were the only thing that differentiated Nanoha from other mahou shoujo, and even then not by much. Conclusion: if you want a solid mahou shoujo, watch Nanoha. If you don‚Äôt like mahou shoujo that much, you‚Äôre not really missing anything. I‚Äôm with Grant though, I WANT MY FUCKING MADOKA."
