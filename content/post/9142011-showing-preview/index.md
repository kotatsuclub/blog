**No.6**

No.6 will be the first anime of the evening.  No.6 is currently airing and is produced by Bones.  It airs in the Noitamina block on Fuji TV.  No.6 focuses around Shion, a privileged and intelligent youth living in the ideal city No.6.  One day, a ragged and exhausted boy stumbles to Shion’s house, and Shion, being young and idealistic, helps the boy and takes care of him.  Soon after, suits show up and start asking questions, which begs the question, is No.6 truly the utopia it’s made out to be?

**Kamisama Dolls**

The second anime of the evening will be Kamisama Dolls.  Kamisama dolls is also currently airing and is produced by Brains Base.  The story focuses on Kyouhei Kuga, a university student in Tokyo, originally from a remote town in the mountains, home to something mysterious.  While living with a family friend from the same village, Kyouhei’s sister Utao arrives at the family’s house unexpectedly.  Utao brings news that a mass murderer, previously Kyouhei’s friend, has escaped from his confinement in the village and is on his way to Tokyo.

**Kami-Sama no Memo-chou**

The final anime on Wednesday will be Kami-Sama no Memo-chou.  Kami-Sama no Memo-chou is currently airing and is produced by J.C. Staff and Sentai Film Works.  From myanimelist.net: Narumi Fujishima is a plain high school boy, who has been isolated in the class. His classmate, Ayaka Shinozaki, invites Narumi to the gardening club and introduces a hikikomori detective named Alice to him.

Alice hires Narumi as an assistant to solve mysterious cases involving an illegal drug “Angel Fix”. But the drug entraps Ayaka into danger.

This showing will be another good one, so make sure to come and bring your friends!  Again, we’ll be in Berthoud 241 and the showing starts at 6 P.M.  We’ll have the room until 11, so don’t worry if you’re late, we still want you! =D  If you haven’t yet paid member dues, it is $2.00 for the semester.  Paying dues lets you access the over 3 TB of anime stored on the club hard drives and also lets us buy pizza and soda for select showings.  You know you want it, so become a member today!  We will also be selling Ramune for $1.50/bottle, way cheaper than you can get from the store, and buying Ramune supports the club.

We’ll see you Wednesday!
