The minute you mentioned Madoka, I could see the similarity in the character designs. Also, bats, pixels, and a seemingly pervasive phone mechanic. Yeah, I‚Äôll bite. Let us know when you have a review up (‚Ä¶but then I‚Äôll already know, won‚Äôt I?).",

I know Nitro+ assisted with Madoka‚Äôs production and made the novel (since Urobuchi works for them), but I don‚Äôt know how involved they were in the art. I think the similarity in design between the Totono heroines and Madoka/Homura is coincidence (or maybe they‚Äôre just lazy, lol).\n\nOut of curiosity, does the RSS feed include comments? If so, I can‚Äôt imagine that‚Äôd be fun to sift through.",
