This blog hasn’t been updated in a while, so I thought I’d post something. Originally it was gonna be how to make custom decals with my newly customized Black Rock Box, but I didn’t have enough funding to buy the papers, so that will have to wait just a little longer.

So I thought I’d post the game I just got, a bland new Nitro+ game. If you’ve heard Nitro+, then, well, you might think you know what’s coming. Don’t worry. It’s about true love, according to Nitro+. Just like how Madoka was about dreams, hopes, and future.

This is not a review. I don’t think I have played enough to actually write a review. This is simply just an introduction to the game.

WARNING: This post might not be for everyone because of the fact that I have the “physical copy of a PC game.” If you know or worry that you are allergic to anything not pirated, then please close this page immediately.

Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi (君と彼女と彼女の恋), abbreviated as totono, is a new Nitro+ game released on June 28th, 2013. It’s the first Nitro+ game to be released on a USB stick.

The story starts with Shinichi, the main character, walking up the stairs with nice background music. I’m not an expert on classic music, but I think it was Moonlight Sonata. Anyway, he is called by his male friend (the typical male side character in almost every VN. I just say almost because I don’t know every single VN.) to the rooftop, but the friend is nowhere to be found.

Then he picks up the phone, which will change his life forever…… I don’t know. I just wanted to say that I guess. What I _do_ know is, that it can change you the player’s life forever. And by life, I mean how you play the game, and by forever, I mean until you uninstall/reinstall/maybe doing some registry stuff.

If you type in the correct number, Kami-sama’s phone number, then the game will check if you are sure. Then it will start counting down in real time. Once the countdown is over, the game will close itself and restart. Grats. You have unlocked all the CGs and music, and stuff. Oh, but you can’t play the game anymore. It will just go back to main menu.

Well, to be honest, I’m not sure on not being able to play the game. It was true on the demo, so I assume it is true on the full game too. This was really interesting feature, so I just wanted to point it out.

This phone also has a game. A “moe game,” a type of game that the player claims to have never played. Yeah, right. Who in Japan wouldn’t have played a moe game? How do you even know it’s called moe, then? Oh, you heard it from your friend. Okay, fine, I’ll trust you.

Anyway, a girl with pink hair falls on our MC and kisses him “for a flag” (I swear that’s what she actually says), MC’s childhood friend, who thinks MC put the love letter calling her to the legendary rooftop, comes up and sees what’s happening and gets mad, and a light, funny, and happy love comedy happens!

The pink haired girl, Aoi, is super denpa. She thinks she is out of power and wants to recharge. I think you guys know how to “recharge the energy” from Fate. And the kiss was “a flag” that was needed to get to it. As you can see, she thinks this is a game (well, duh, this _is_ a game.), and no one in the class cares about her denpa-ness anymore.

On the other hand, childhood friend-chan, Miyuki, is the school idol type character. Everyone in the school likes her. And because of her being popular, she and MC are not really close. You know, typical scenario when the childhood friend is also the school idol. Of course, Aoi points out that childhood friend characters never work out at the end.

And our MC, Shinichi, thinks being friends with Aoi might “fix her denpa-ness.” So far, Miyuki didn’t seem to like it, but I’m guessing she will help.

Things happen, Shinichi gets close to the two girls, picks one (or gets harem end), epilogue, and so on…

If this wasn’t a Nitro+ game, that is…

However……. short time before release, Nitro+ announced that they want this game to be the next Saya no Uta. They also released some info on the game system. It looks like the plot changes drastically by your choices. For example…

Huh, what? Stop spoiling? No, I’m not spoiling. They are from the official webpage. That’s the point of this game. Nitro+ will show you how messed up it can be at the end, and you want to know how exactly it happens. At least that’s why I got the game.

Sadly, it is not written by Urobuchi, but the writer has written a pretty dark VN from Nitro+ before.

The art looks great. Well, except some of the H-scenes, but who cares, right? You all play an eroge for the plot, right?

The music is also good. It’s really calm and soothing piano music, but that’s probably because I haven’t gotten to the “good” parts yet. But I’m pretty sure those music will be great.

I wanted to post the package and all, but I used up all the space we have in this blog again. I’m pretty sure it was me the first time too.

And here is the [demo](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3cvW3NVRsnrNElsSWtITjV6dms/edit?usp=sharing).

PS: Maybe you want the phone number. Here it is: 080-9184-6920.

PS2: Let’s see how long it will take someone to notice a new post if I don’t tell anyone about the it.
