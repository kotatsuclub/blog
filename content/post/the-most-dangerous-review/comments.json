            "Content": "Did anybody else read this entire thing in Matt’s voice?\n\nThat said, I applaud you for reviewing this many bad anime in a single sitting. Furthermore, I applaud you for actually figuring out what happened in MD Geist.\n\nKannazuki no Miko, Horizon, and Sky Girls were all about as good as I expected them to be (especially Horizon, which NEVER SEEMED TO FUCKING END I SWEAR THOSE EPISODES WERE ACTUALLY LIKE 45 MINUTES A PIECE). R-15 was almost funny, but as you noted, it devolved into standard boring harem. Tytania was actually pretty interesting, in a weird political Sentai kind of way. MD Geist was hilariously bad, and it feels unfair seriously reviewing it. I didn’t pay any attention at all to Wakfu and MLP, so for all I know, they were the greatest shows ever, but I don’t think they were. And Megas XLR is amazing, and if anyone disagrees, fuck you.\n\nLook forward to the next one."
