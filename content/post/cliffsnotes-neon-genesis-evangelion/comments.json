I’m surprised that someone was able to sum up the whole series so well. I never would have thought of trying to do that. This post does make me feel less bad about liking Evangelion so much, though. Most of this stuff I knew, but seeing a lot of the more tricky and decidedly ‘wtfh’ stuff so orderly and concise was very nice. I daresay I learned some things, too!\n\nThe trivia at the end was also pretty neat, haha. I had no idea Rei’s VA was everywhere like that. Faye? Ranma? HELLO KITTY? Oh, my.\n\nAnyway, yeah, I liked the post. I think anybody who cares about Evangelion for any reason should read this–especially if they were ever confused at any point, which is probably likely as long as you aren’t Hideaki Anno."
