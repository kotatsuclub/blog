The "Living in a magical world" zeitgeist
Re:Zero is, to me, a very rare show. In a time in anime where the most popular shows are about boys sent to alternate worlds (with their girlfriends), adult themes are attempted, but rarely successfully. It's easy to point to SAO season 2, which introduced a character with AIDS (which was rather sanguine) when there are other shows that fell under the radar that tried the same thing in their own genres. A lot of original "magical girl" genre shows try to tackle death, friendship, and the crossroads between them seemingly for shock value; something I refer to as the Madoka effect. The "inserted into a magical world" genre got that same shock with Zero, taking on numerous issues all at once in a vivid imagining of that possible reality. Where other anime tell the viewer that yes, you're just like this character and could survive easily in a reality far removed from your own, appealing to the lack of belonging one may feel in our reality; Re:Zero calls that expectation foolish, and creates a world that is beyond comprehension to someone who has never tried engaging in their own society.

In a somewhat specific and coincidental way, "Now and Then, Here and There" attempted this premise as well.

Framing NTHT

>  *"Shu is a typical Japanese boy, but has an unbeatable, optimistic and determined attitude. However, when he sees a mysterious girl with strange eyes named Lala-Ru up on a smokestack, he is soon pulled into a strange desert world. Shu soon discovers the true terrors of war, which includes genocide, brutal torture, hunger, thirst, and child explotation."* -ANN

Shu is a lot younger than Subaru (Shu is between 10 and 12) and doesn't have the luxury of some of the things Subaru gets, so the stakes always feel much, much higher by comparison. However, a boy is taken to a magical world to save a silver-haired girl that everyone hates, a fact of which the boy and some regular folks fail to understand- in fact, they generally die for their lack of understanding. Besides all of that death, there's also unsettlingly long depictions of molestation and sexual violence. NTHT is a reality check that other worlds aren't going to be better because they're different from our own. As a matter of fact, they could be a whole hell of a lot worse. We can say it never happens in our own world, either, but [it can, and it does](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-25/four-corners-evidence-of-kids-tear-gas-in-don-dale-prison/7656128) It's merely by coincidence that both NTHT and Re:Zero have a silver-haired, mysterious female lead that the male protag falls for.

Fantasy Worlds
As a literary device, "transported to a fantasy world" is for introducing a theme or concept from a translucent lens unmarred by previous bias, or perhaps offering a unique one to the world spun by a different view. Re:Zero and NTHT are the latter. Anime says the pretty girl with the strange outfit must be the heroine that needs saving, where the new world calls her the villain that doesn't belong. Then major serious themes are explored related to society, ambitions, and power (if only it were the electrical kind). Their ideals aren't complex, all just about boil down to "might makes right"; but then it focuses on various aspects of that idea. Whether it's children fighting wars for the adults in NTHT, or those that take advantage of a society's natural disregard for half-elves in Re:Zero, everyone's just an unreasonable jerk.

The knots weaved in Re:Zero are political, requiring a serious understanding of subtext and others' ambitions. Episode 16 of Re:Zero (only 13 episodes in NTHT) was a somewhat bizarre spelling out of this concept to Subaru, and by extension, the audience. As the show is currently airing at the time of this writing, I don't want to spoil much- but Subaru's ideas of what is "right" are justified by the bodies he saves, a view no one in the new world shares. The show spells this out fairly explicitly from the start: It's rare to see someone give a shit about people, for the sake of giving a shit about people.

Chivalry doesn't pay

NTHT's Shu had the same simplistic motivations as Subaru. Thrust into a new place, they figured they were the hero in a place that was in dire need of saving. Characters in all such stories are always assume they're the hero. Maybe they have something no one else has that makes them the perfect solution to whatever is going on. This happens in other anime, much like the King Arthur "sword in the stone" myth. Divine providence tells us that because something this unexpected happened, they must be given the power to solve whatever is wrong. They must do good.

When the world instead spits on that, that is not only playing with the hero's expectations, but also the viewers. That playing with expectations asks the viewer important questions about why these things make people feel the way they do. Pause and Select did a fantastic video on this in NTHT with the concept of necropower:
