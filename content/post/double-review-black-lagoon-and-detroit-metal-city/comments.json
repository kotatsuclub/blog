            "Content": "I’ll only comment on Black Lagoon since it’s the only one I’ve seen of the two.\n\nGrant’s description of the show is pretty accurate. You watch this show for the violence/action in the first season and the story in The Second Barrage. Black Lagoon is definitely one of my favorite animes. I don’t know if it’s in my top 10, but it’s definitely up there.\n\nQuick note, the 6 OVAs being released over the next few months are supposed to be the “third season.” The series of OVAs is titled “Roberta’s Blood Trail.” So far, only two of the six are released and subbed (I have them in 1080p if they’re not already on the hard drive). The story brings back the characters from the final arc in season one and increases the awesome by 9001x. The OVAs are definitely worth wathing (whenever they finally are completed… next year sometime I think) unless you’re not a huge fan of gore, in which case you should still watch this series (yes, there’s A LOT of blood and violence).\n\nAlso side note for Gene, Chaeha, and anybody that likes EVA:\n\nRumor has it that Rebuild 3.33 is due this coming March.\n\nOH HAPPY DAYS\n\n\u003c( °.° °.° )\\\u003e\n\n^(^3^)^\n\n^^Dancing Emote FTW^^",

            "Content": "Coincidentally, I just watched DMC a few weeks ago on my own. DMC is a nice little anime to just sit back and laugh at. its a nice break from all that hardcore anime watching due to its unique style and humor. definitely worth looking into, especially since its so short. I kinda wish they wrapped it up a bit more in the end, though.\n\nNow, Black lagoon, I don’t know what more to add except that i can’t really compare it to any other anime I’ve seen. cowboy bebop, maybe, like gene said, but more gore and guns and battle-ready maids/loli twins/everything. It’s definitely worth the watch.\n\nTL;DR: I vouch for both these."
