Well due to the possibility of the next stalker game to be set in japan, I have decided to return early.  I had done short day trips to Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo but I wanted to spend more time in these locations before doing proper posts on them.  So heres a combo post on a few places to sightsee while in japan.

Akihabara:

This is one of the more crazy places in japan. It is mostly known for being the place to get all the otaku goods you want. But it is also a place where you can get any sort of electronic goods.   There are stores with racks of broken oscilloscopes.

When I took this trip to Tokyo I was going with 3 other girls from the langue school.  Just after we were leaving the train station we all saw one of the maids from a maid cafe. The first thing two of them said was “I want to go to a maid cafe.”  We all went to the maid cafe, me and three girls.  I could tell by how the other people around there were looking at our group that I was trolling them hard.

Osaka:

I didn’t spend long in this town but I have heard from people that its residents are more friendly then the rest of japan.  Its also known for awesome food.

On my short trip I only went to the castle there.

Kyoto:

Old capital of Japan. This is the place to go for historic Japanese culture.  There are tons of temples and Shinto shrines all over the place here.

While looking around on google maps I saw a cool island shrine in gamagori.

Today I going to Tokyo again on my way out of the country. I’ll do a second post tomorrow on the disaster and the state of Tokyo.  Well I’m off to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. shadow of Fukushima. I hope there aren’t any zombie dogs.
