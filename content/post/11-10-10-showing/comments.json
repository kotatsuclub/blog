If anybody else plays bb though, you should definitely tell me, I need some people to play offline.\n\nBack on topic, my favorite show was Requiem for the Phantom. Maybe that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs essentially Darker than Black, and I like DtB. Occult Academy was meh, and I didn‚Äôt really like Blue Gender. I think I might like Blue Gender without shitty English voice actors, and when I‚Äôm actually paying attention, AND without the incessant heckling that tends to happen at the showings =(.\n\numee, where is my shiki‚Ä¶ =(",

But it seems more like a character Laura Bailey can play, considering her other roles, so I figured she would work as an example. But yeah, I guess I can‚Äôt be too sure‚Ä¶\n\nI don‚Äôt currently have Continuum Shift, but I still like to play BlazBlue whenever I can, so that sounds like good news to me, haha.\n\nI‚Äôve always heard good things about Darker than Black, but never seen it, so I guess I ought to. I agree about the heckling, though. It seems like it would be hard for ANYONE to enjoy a show when half of the people in the room are trying so hard not to enjoy it.",
