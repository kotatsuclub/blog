**C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control**

And so it begins.  C is our recurring show this semester.  C aired during this past spring and was produced by Funimation.    C also ran in the noitaminA (you’re welcome Chaeha) block.  We will be watching two episodes tonight; I’m not sure if this will be the only preview for this show or if I’ll do a preview for each week’s episodes.  Leave a comment if you feel one one way or the other.

This anime is set in modern Japan and follows Kimimaro, an economics major in college.  Kimimaro is at university on scholarship who also works two part-time jobs to help pay for school; Kimimaro’s father disappeared years ago and his mother died shortly after leaving him in this difficult financial situation.  One evening, a mysterious, comical man appears at Kimimaro’s apartment door and offers Kimimaro a loan.  There are two conditions to this loan: the money is to be spent in “The Financial District,” the collateral for the loan is Kimimaro’s future (queue dramatic music).  Show up tonight and see what happens!

# Eiga Precure All Stars DX3: Mirai ni Todoke! Sekai wo Tsunagu Niji-iro no Hana (aka Gene has shit taste)

I’m not even going to try on this one lol.  From myanimelist.net: Precure 10th Anniversary Movie and 3rd [Precure All Stars](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=precure%20all%20stars "Shopping link added by Skimlinks") DX. Enemies are from all the Precure works.

So if you like it you’ll like it, and if you don’t you’ll probably be confused the entire night (I know I will).  I’ll be looking forward to Grant’s/Matt’s review of this one lol.

I hope the Precure Movie doesn’t scare too many of you guys away!  As always member dues are $2.00 for the semester and get you access to the club hard drives and pay for pizza and sodas!  Make sure you become a member today!  We’re still selling Ramune for $1.50 as well.  Supporting us lets us put together cool things for you guys, so bring your quarters!
