Yeah, as surprising as it probably is, that was about the extent of my anime experience prior to coming to Mines. And then I was never one to really admit my own tastes, even to myself, so I skipped through 2, and then I was never one to comment on other people’s tastes, so it didn’t really matter if I was in stage 3, and now I’m just floating around somewhere between stages 2 and 5. That or I’m out on stage i on my own complex track."

It really needs to be stickied on /a/, but let’s not go there… However, you kind of imply that in stage 5 you pretty much like anything that’s out there. Whether one wants to admit it or not. I don’t think that’s quite true, but it’s a fine hair to split.\n\nWhat I \\*do\\* think is partly playing into all this screaming about “taste” is that when we make a decision about liking or not liking something, we have worked out reasons for it in our own heads. To one degree or another, perhaps even subconsciously. When someone comes along and \\*dares\\* to have differing taste, they have violated those carefully worked-out reasons in our heads and what kind of idiot would go against what is clearly the most logical and best reasoning we could come up with at the spur of the moment in a completely emotional reaction about something we saw at 1:28 a.m. in a cheetos-fueled haze?\n\nIn the end, I think your point is spot-on: we should all make peace with the fact that people like things we hate. To mangle the old adage, “I may not like your shounen drivel filler crap, but I will defend to the death your right to drown in it’s insipid plotline until it’s no longer profitable for Shonen Jump.” Or something like that.",

                    "Content": "Yeah, my thoughts in Stage 5 could have been better worded. I’m basically saying that we might not like everything (and indeed, we may find we really _do_ hate some genres), but we’ve come to terms with the fact we might like _some_ “garbage,” and we’re okay with displaying it openly. In essence, we have come to understand ourselves.\n\nI’ve definitely called people out on “poor” taste before, but I’d never question someone’s right to poor taste. I might argue with them about what’s good and what’s not, but I will argue as equals.\n\nHmm…by my own scale, I’d have to call myself a mix of 3, 4, and 5. I certainly parade out the elitist attitude from time to time (particularly at showings), but usually, it’s in jest. And, as you’ve probably all picked up from the less-than-subtle Freudian overtones here, I’ve come to accept that I don’t hate silly, moe, trivial slice-of-life shows as much as thought I did.\n\nDaniel: Yeah, the stages I put here are a pretty broad generalization, and it’d be unfair to say everyone goes through them. I wrote them mostly for the lulz, and partly because I think most of us can painfully relate to at least one stage. And Stage i…is that like some zen state in which you exist outside of all anime and thus know all? Aha, I knew it, that’s the secret to all of your abilities!\n\nGrant: ohyou.jpg"

Back when Sailor Moon first came over. “You have a Sailor Moon wand? You are such a dorky noob. Your parents bought that for you in Japan? What a waste of money. I have zero respect for you.”\n\nIn college, I was suck on step 2. If it was out, I’d watch it. I’d be hunched in my chair, headphones on, watching on fast-forward because all I had to read was the subtitles. I hated OPs, EDs, and anything that wasn’t the story.\n\nAnd then all of a sudden — step 5. I just stopped. I spend all my time on cosplay now, and you can’t sew and read subtitles at the same time. Well, all except for Saki. I inflict Saki on everyone. Saki is the shoujo-bubbliest, yuri-hinting-est, high school tournament show about mahjongg ever made. (Y’all should watch it.)",
