For the Fate/Stay Night movie, I wasn’t sure if I fell asleep momentarily (I mean, I was tired that day, so it could have actually happened), but some parts seemed to go really fast. Like they would say something about someone killing all the people in a city and I would think, “What? Did I miss that part?”",

I felt like half the time I was missing some critical piece of information to understand _why_ we cared what was happening. Damn purty, though.\n\nCarnival Phantasm was bukkets of fun, even if I didn’t understand half the jokes going on. I especially liked the gag in the OP with Assassin sitting in front of the arch for all eternity."
