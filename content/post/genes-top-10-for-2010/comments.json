            "Content": "Haha, excellent list. Despite the fact I haven‚Äôt really seen half of it. 27 shows this year, eh? Well, if we assume half were 13-episode and the other were 26 (an average of 19.5 episodes a show), that you finished each show, that you watched each episode in its entirety (24 minutes), and spent 1 minute afterwards reflecting/complaining/etc (25 minutes total per episode), you wasted about 9 days this year on anime. I‚Äôd make a condescending remark concerning your productivity, but I don‚Äôt think I was that much better.\n\n74-episode Angel Beats? Hell, I‚Äôd watch that, if it meant I got to see every character‚Äôs story in full detail. Not to mention having an excuse to watch the OP and ED 74 times. As for learning the OP on piano, do you mean you specific arrangement of it w/ sheet music, or just a general play-it-by-ear method? If the former, hit me up. If the latter, it‚Äôs not too tough üòõ\n\nI totally remember _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_, I used to watch it all the time.\n\nTatami Galaxy was awesome, but I think I went over that in a previous post. For anyone who hasn‚Äôt watched it, go watch it.\n\nBaka to Test is probably one of the funniest shows I‚Äôve seen, up there with FMP Fumoffu? and Azumanga Daioh. Not to mention that it spawned an entirely new sexual orientation. It‚Äôs terribly confusing seeing a picture with both of the Kinoshita twins in it and trying to guess the trap. Did you fap to the wrong one? Are you gay? YOU‚ÄôLL NEVER KNOW!\n\nLol at OreImo ranking at #1, but really, it was a great show. Definitely looking forward to the BD release this summer. Meeerumerumerumerumerumerume~!\n\nAs for Seikon no Qwaser‚Ä¶I have to agree it‚Äôs probably the worst thing I‚Äôve seen at showings outside of Bad Anime Night (still remember watching the first episode uncensored during last E-Days). Almost sorry I dragged Kurt to it, but then we showed DMC, so it was alright.\n\nPersonal top 10 is in the works. I swear.",

            "Content": "Oh boy, I‚Äôm gonna get so much shit for this. Honestly, I thought OreImo was a trainwreck. So **horrible**, but I just couldn‚Äôt look away for some reason. The two lead characters are all but unlikeable, no one shows any growth/change/depth (Kirino showed a tiny, tiny hint of it in ep11), the plots are contrived (see: Kirino‚Äôs novel), and the show ends on a weird anticlimax after yet another subplot that comes out of nowhere. Hopefully the ‚ÄúTrue End‚Äù can salvage it a bit, but I‚Äôll mostly be watching for the supporting cast. And ep6. \u003c3 ep6.\n\nOn to other things!\n\nIt occurs to me that this summer was the first time I actively \"followed\" a series after seeing the season lineup. Previously, I just picked up shows after the fact via word of mouth from friends or the internet. I feel ‚Ä¶ \"qualified\" as an anime geek now. **;\\_;**\n\n74 episodes of Angel Beats, eh? That‚Äôs only a little longer than the good part of Bleach. If it maintained the quality level, I probably could have slogged through that. If it wouldn‚Äôt have absolutely bankrupted P.A. Works, a 26-episode run would have been the sweet spot for it, IMO. The extra episode is out now, too, although I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a 720p anywhere at the moment. Definitely waiting on that.\n\nKuroko‚Äôs pretty funny in Railgun. Something about her voice just seems so right for her personality. Even better, though, was having her characterization associated with her seiyuu when I watched Okami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi make the Narrator‚Äôs lines 10 times funnier when I imagined Kuroko delivering them.\n\nI guess I‚Äôll put together some thoughts on shows I‚Äôve watched from this year too. Probably haven‚Äôt seen enough to put together a full top-10, so I‚Äôll settle for making a top three and listing the rest.",

WHY ARE YOU BEING SO FRIENDLY? Kimoi‚Ä¶\n\nAye, a 26 ep run would‚Äôve been the beautiful compromise. 74 episodes is just Maeda Jun covering a year (and progressively bankrupting PA Works, of course). Also you‚Äôre not imagining things, there‚Äôs no 720p rip and the standard definition one hurts my eyes.\n\nKuroko‚Äôs funny in railgun and Index II. I prefer Index II but I‚Äôll take either.

Since I haven‚Äôt seen the top two shows I‚Äôll just pretend Tatami placed on top‚Ä¶\n\nMore seriously, though, I enjoyed the read. And yes, I do remember Are You Afraid of the Dark?, if only so vaguely. I think I stuck with Goosebumps as a child more because the other would legitimately scare me, and I‚Äôm not good at SCARY THINGS.\n\nI‚Äôm kind of surprised Seikimatsu placed on the list, too, so that‚Äôs a show I may have to revisit. I think I plan on giving each of the shows I haven‚Äôt seen a fair shot too, though, since I have heard good things about a couple of them. There are too many I have to see, blahhh‚Ä¶\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm proud(?) to say that I‚Äôve never seen Seikon no Qwaser. So I can‚Äôt exactly offer any sort of opinion on it, but considering that little horror story, I don‚Äôt need to.\n\nAnd while I‚Äôm reluctant to say that a full-blown 74-episode Angel Beats! would have been _better_, I do rather yearn for a more fleshed-out cast of characters. I probably would have ended up watching most of it (I want to say I would watch it all but I still haven‚Äôt seen all of Monster, an arguably superior show, at least in my humble view).\n\nEnjoyed the list, though, like I said.

            "Content": "SO MANY TOP 10 LISTS‚Ä¶ I have so much reading to do lol\n\nI figured I would post in this one because it talked about the PSG soundtrack (psst WHICH I HAVE AND AM WILLING TO SHARE =D).\n\nI feel like AngelBeats could have done much more if Key took their time with it. Clannad is 48(?) episodes all told and it‚Äôs appropriately spaced. At least we get another season of AB this coming year lol. Where the feck is B Gata H Kei? That show made me laugh so hard every episode. Consistent and funny.\n\nAlso‚Ä¶ all of you are high for not having Shiki at #1. Best show I‚Äôve ever seen, or maybe I like psychological/mystery shows too much‚Ä¶ Oreimo at 1? lol gene‚Ä¶ lol‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs good but‚Ä¶\n\nSo next year we get season 2 of AngelBeats, Seitokai Yakuindomo (sexjokes, the anime), and The World God Only Knows. Also the ‚ÄúTrue End‚Äù of Oreimo and a series of OVAs for YnS that will be OVAs for obvious reasons. More Black Lagoon too. Don‚Äôt forget Hellsing: Ultimate 8! (lol jk‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs never coming out).",

                    "Content": "B Gata H Kei isn‚Äôt on there for the same reason Seitokai Yakuindomo isn‚Äôt on there, and that is because of all the sex. PARTICULARLY THE LACK THEREOF (trollface)\n\nBy that line of logic YnS should‚Äôve been on there butI‚Äôve never seen that show ever so it‚Äôs not on there. That being said, the sora arc was the best thing I‚Äôve never seen.\n\nI keep forgetting about Black Lagoon and how I like that show. Thanks for reminding me, I need to catch up on that. There have been a few OVAs or another season or summat‚Ä¶ right?",
