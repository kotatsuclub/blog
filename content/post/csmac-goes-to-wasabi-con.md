Oh yes oh yes indeed! CSM's Anime Club is running a showroom today to Sunday at Wasabi Con at Crowne Plaza! Come say hi to the president, treasurer, and myself as we watch some great shows, rock out to some awesome AMVs and, of course, poke fun at everything that happens on screen because we are nitpicky jerks.

But seriously, you should totally come by. It'll be hotter than a Charizard using Flamethrower!
