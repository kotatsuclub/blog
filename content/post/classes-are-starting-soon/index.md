Just in case you forgot. Now wouldn’t that be embarassing! Hahaha, oh man…

It’s hard to believe how much crap came out this past semester as well as what’s expected to come out this coming semester. Truly, it is a shame we don’t have anything to look forward to ever. The good news is this means we can bring back my favorite special showing of all time! The special showings I’m planning on are the following:

- Bad anime night
- Live-action night
- Disturbia Night (not limited to just once a year~!)
- Craploads of movies and OVAs
- Really good anime night (week of E-days, OH BOY PIZZA)

Bad anime night will probably be the week of April Fool’s, and we’ll probably be showing a _lot_ of movies because we just simply lack the anime to be consistently good. I think I’ve said that before. I’ve said that before? Ok never mind. You all know the drill.

## What I did over break

I’m almost embarrassed to admit what total crap I spent my time watching, but then I remember that this is an anime blog. There’s no way I could’ve spent my time watching anything BUT total nonsense.

Finished Yosuga no Sora, despite having never watched the show ever. I had no idea how easy it was too hook up with women. Apparently you just say your name… and then all of them just… and then you have a twin sister… and she does unspeakable things to you in the middle of the night… hahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHA! GOD THIS SHOW IS AWFUL. I don’t think I’ve ever hated the characters in a show this much since that time I watched Valkyria Chronicles.

I also finished Kara no Kyoukai (finally) just the other day. As soon as I did that, it became my favorite anime of all time. ’nuff said, that show made me chum buckets. Highly recommend watching it at least 5 times and buy the $600 blu-ray box set. On an unrelated note, I didn’t get that for Christmas but I really wish I did.

Finished all those other shows that I was watching too, of course. PSG, Shiki, Squid girl, ~~motto to love-ru~~, MM, Soredemo machi wa Mawatteiru, and craploads of movies because we’ll be watching all of them this semester.

Oh yeah, before I forget, Amagami-SS finished too. I really liked that show. Some dull arcs here and there, of course, but overall a great show. I think I said enough about it in the top 10, but I just thought I’d mention that. I also finished Tegami Bachi and Reverse. Sorry, thought it was boring, but it wasn’t by any means a _bad_ show.

Speaking of boring but not bad, I also watched some American television as well. Dexter from Showtime was a pretty good psychological/mystery/police drama. It definitely helped cleanse the palette.

Comiket79 was also over break. I got that umineko game I was looking forward to. Chaeha and I have been playing it to death, it’s a pretty fun fighter.

I also re-installed Oblivion. I’m sure at this point most of you can tell I didn’t leave my room this break. LIVIN’ THE DREAM.

## Stuff coming up that’s getting released this week and the next

Infinite Stratos and Magical Girl Madoka whatever both just got released. IS is obviously a total haremfest and it basically blows, but I always end up watching and finishing these goddamn harem shows every season (Ichiban Ushiro no Daimau, MM!, friggin’ TWGOK). Probably a personality flaw.

Madoka, on the other hand, is more SHAFT craziness, which I love. To be honest, in this industry practically saturated with moeblobs, predictable plots, and unchanging character archetypes, its just nice to have a show with good art direction. SHAFT has had this by the neck, even if most of their shows are starting to look the same. I’m a little unhappy that it sounds a bit like I’m just playing the game for the graphics or watching a movie because it has my favorite actor, but these days its important to remember what you really like about anime, and hold out for the really good stuff. I’m talking about the stuff that really only comes out once every two years.

Have we shown that killer show? Really, that’s based solely on opinion, but we don’t really know until we try. Hopefully you’ll all stick this out with me, because I’m sure there’s bound to be a diamond in the rough at _some_ point. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go watch [Heartcatch PreCure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q08us3GK_U).
