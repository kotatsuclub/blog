It‚Äôs not too short to get into a non-curricular activity (like Thanksgiving or Spring Breaks) or too long to get through without winding up bored (like Summer Vacation). There‚Äôs 4ish days left until classes start again, and I‚Äôm just about ready to get back into classes. Wish we could could swap to a year-round school year with WB-length vacations, but you know, politics. Or something.\n\nAlso, I _finally_ got through all the anime from Fall 2010 that I wanted to finish before putting together a ‚Äúyear in review‚Äù piece for the blog. (Well, I guess I have the Megana na Kanojo OVAs left) I would have finished earlier I think if not for the ridiculous rewards for a certain Wintersday quest in Guild Wars. Said quest rewards were farmed so hard by everyone (myself included) that _two sectors of the in-game economy all but crashed_. Ugh.\n\nNow to go actually write that piece. Or read more HP and the Methods of Rationality. Hmmmm.",

I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I really didn‚Äôt get any viewing at all, except for rewatching some stuff I‚Äôve already seen (Disappearance, Girl Who Leapt Through Time, FLCL, stuff‚Ä¶). I guess there was that one episode of Amagami‚Ä¶\n\nThat is, unless playing the story mode in BlazBlue counts as watching anime. I guess the lack of actual _animation_ (unless seeing the portraits go omnomnom during dialogue counts) excludes it, though.\n\nI‚Äôve seen the pilot of Dexter, and yeah, it doesn‚Äôt look too terrible. My better half is obsessed with the novels, so I end up hearing a lot about it, but I‚Äôve yet to try diving in.\n\nAnyway, I don‚Äôt have anything particular to say about the coming semester‚Äôs shows, since I‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶ seen them, but I‚Äôm hoping for some good showings! I‚Äôll probably be pleased either way, though. I‚Äôm not exactly the most selective audience."

First half of winter was pretty much video games and anime (finished Mushishi), and second half went to recovering from wisdom teeth extraction, which means it also consisted of video games and anime (almost finished with Black Lagoon, which I am really enjoying).\n\nDespite Winter 2011 failing to impress me, I‚Äôve decided to give it a chance, so I‚Äôll try to watch at least 2-3 episodes of everything that comes out. Infinite Stratos looks pretty much set to dive into the standard harem recipe (as if one couldn‚Äôt tell from the premise). Unless it deviates and gets interesting, fast, I probably won‚Äôt finish it. Or maybe I will ‚Äì I finished K-On!!, after all. Madoka gives me mixed feelings. It feels so ordinary and cliche, but the Shaft artstyle never fails to be interesting. It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs like being served Taco Bell on a silver platter, at a fancy restaurant, in an airport.\n\nI‚Äôm waiting to see if anyone else is subbing Gosick before I reluctantly take the HS 480p. I hope a decent group subs it in HD, because it‚Äôs one of the few shows I was planning on watching this season anyway.I‚Äôm grabbing Cardfight now‚Ä¶although I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôm looking forward to it.\n\nOh, right ‚Äì You can‚Äôt have Bad Anime Night when _every night_ is bad anime night!
