I got bored and thought I should come up with a Japanese pseudonym or something.

So, here it is, 朴宰厦、ぼく さいか, Boku Saika.

Well, that’s exactly my name in Korean too, just different readings.

But that sounds like a girl’s name. And with a last name of “boku” too which makes it even more weird. And either the last kanji seems to be used in very few words in today’s Japanese, or uses different forms from Korean, so I couldn’t find the meaning reading part of it (like how “mountain” is “san/zan” and “yama”? “san” is the sound, and “yama” is the meaning)

Or I could add a “no” and make it Hou no Saika. Now it sounds like a noble name! Oh, did I tell you? My mom’s name could be Akihime, which sounds like a royal name. Even better. (You know, back then in Japan, royal family didn’t really get to use their names. They used the title.) I think it’s pretty cool.

Then I started looking up my other family member’s names. My dad’s is easy. It’s Kairyuu. Man, that’s even worse than a cheap shonen hero. Okay, let’s look at the other sound. Umitatsu. Well, that sounds more like a person’s name. (I’m not trying to say anything bad about that name, but it’s pretty old name, and it literally means an actual thing. Well, it doesn’t exist in real life. That’s probably why it doesn’t sound like a person’s name. And I don’t wanna say the meaning myself cause it’s kinda funny, but I bet some of you can figure it out by the sound of it.)

My sister’s name could be one of the following: Shini, Shinin, Shijin, etc. Nothing really sounds good here either. BUT the second kanji (which is first kanji in first name) can be read as Itaru, which is the pen name of the main illustrator in Key, though it’s just in hiragana. Her work includes… well, just about every major Key games.

So that means my sister’s name also could be Itani. That sounds like a family name.

In conclusion, Korean names don’t work as Japanese names. (Well, duh!)

PS: My first kanji can also be Tsukasa. Sigh, I feel even worse.

PS2: In Japanese law, names can only have certain kanjis, but the pronunciation is not restricted by any means. So 戦人, normally “Sento,” (even then, it’s not a common pronunciation) could be “Batora,” or Battler. Which means what I did was a total waste of time and say it’s pronounced as “Shiawasagi.” I bet that last kanji is not even one of the kanji I can use in names.
