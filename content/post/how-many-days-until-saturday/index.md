Fall sweeps starts this weekend, so Japan is whipping out the good stuff. Check out the [chart](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uOboqselkE8/TGlKs1S2ifI/AAAAAAAAAME/mv7Vnh62HVc/s1600/anime_fall_2010_chart.jpg) and see what you think. I’m withholding judgment on a lot of these until I see them, but there are a few I’m going to be giving a shot:{{<figure src="../files/2010/09/My-Little-Sis%C2%ADter-Can%E2%80%99t-Be-This-Cute-Ore-no-Imouto-ga-Konna-ni-Kawaii-Wake-ga-Nai.jpg" link="../files/2010/09/My-Little-Sis%C2%ADter-Can%E2%80%99t-Be-This-Cute-Ore-no-Imouto-ga-Konna-ni-Kawaii-Wake-ga-Nai.jpg" width="206" height="320">}}

- My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute
- Bakuman
- The World God Only Knows
- Arakawa 2
- A Certain Magical Index 2
- Mirai Nikki
- Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt

I’m liking a few of the sequels, but as for the new best, I’m really excited for [Panty & Stocking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtpBLQM9Xn4), and [Mirai Nikki](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52P0DM-JDMg). Both look frightening, but the material they’re based on is pretty good. Nonetheless, time will tell if we show them next season. We might push P&S/G out at the end of this semester, but the rest on that list will most likely be shown next semester. {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/09/Panty-Stocking-lolis1_4307.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/09/Panty-Stocking-lolis1_4307.jpg" width="311" height="300">}}We’ve got the showings for this semester on lockdown already. Might want to look at the TVtropes for these, while you’re at it. Makes for good reading (and a great way to kill an afternoon).

Anyway, my week’s pretty much over now. I think Christian tried to stop by this afternoon but I wasn’t here. I guess that’s what I get for going to class. Sorry I missed you, but remember that 5:00 PM onward I’m not doing anything unless its anime club or fraternity related.

Three more weeks until the best showing ever…
