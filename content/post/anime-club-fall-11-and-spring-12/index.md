For you new freshmen, welcome! To you returning upper-classmen, welcome back! To the rest of you, put that gun down! You have so much to live for! It’s another great year of anime club to look forward to with more anime, more lack of sleep on Thursdays, and even more of me embarrassing myself in public. I’ve already changed the website banner to the show we’re featuring this semester, as well as had Matt print out the new ACTUAL banner we’ll be using this year; no more of the Naruto/Full Metal Panic. I think we’ll be keeping it for posterity or we’ll take it to cons or whatnot, I don’t really know.

The bottom part is an approximation because I actually wrote it in my last Vice President’s blood. It’s ok, Matt’s still alive everybody.

# Who are you and why are you taking my money

Glad you asked! We’ll be discussing this more in the first meeting, but essentially I pick some anime to show every week and we show it. I am a “President” of the club, per se. Some people have other names for me, such as “Jesus,” as in “Jesus, will you just sit the f\*ck down and stop talking?” More information on me and the rest of the officers are in the tab labeled “officers” at the top, as well as our mug shots from that one E-days that only Daniel (our previous media officer) remembers.

At the first meeting we’ll talk about the various events we do over the course of this year and the next. It’s mostly cons and visiting other anime clubs in Colorado. Speaking of that, on Thursday (August 25th) we’re going to travel to CSU-Ft. Collins. More on this at the first meeting as well. Keep it in the back of your mind though.

As for your money, well, dues are $2 and they pay for pizza.

# So I heard you say something about anime…

As I’ll be discussing on the first day, we show three different anime at each showing, three episodes apiece. When exams pick up we switch to the featured show and movies. Once we show something, we never show it again. As a result, we usually only put on things that are new or slipped through the cracks over the years.

After the showings we talk about what was shown or what people are up to. Sometimes we’ll do a “let’s play -” and have people try their hand at whatever video game I bought recently. Last year had some fun moments with Portal 2 and Amnesia. Considering what games are coming out this year and the next, that’s likely to continue. For now, we have Touhou 13.

# Housekeeping

Like I said, we’re visiting CSU-Ft. Collins next week. I also deleted a ton of pictures from the site that were either old or too big. This meant I removed Alex’s pictures from when he was in Japan, but those will live on on the anime club hard drive for posterity. Steve is the new Vice President/Treasurer and Chaeha is our new Media Officer. I’m only going to be President for this remaining semester so there’ll be a scramble to wrangle new officers for next semester. Hope you guys don’t hate C too much this semester, I already changed the banner and it’s been decided. Besides, it’s not THAT bad, and it’s only 11 episodes.

Oh yeah, and help out at the anime club booth during celebration of Mines if you can. That’d be cool, yo.

**So welcome! If you are a new student, please leave a comment! The sooner I know you, the sooner I can start trying to remember your name. If you are a returning student, please continue pretending that your parents made a good choice sending you to this school and leaving you with me. Thanks!**
