It’s new year, and the ad for 2nd episode of Touhou anime project was released in C79 (though I haven’t seen it yet), so I thought I’d post something new.

Sadly, I don’t really know doujin works with pro seiyuus other than some of the Touhou stuff.

So, when I first heard the Maikaze casted pro people for their Touhou anime project, I couldn’t understand how they were able to hire those people. It turned out that when seiyuus work for doujin circle, the circle can pay whatever they want, when in the professional world, they have to pay them according to seiyuus’ rank. Of course whether seiyuus take the job is their call, so they can’t pay them too little.

- Nakahara Mai-san as Hakurei Reimu

Nakahara-san is one of the few Japanese people that I know by kanji. Her acting skills are pretty good in my opinion. Two types of her voices I heard were cute-girl voices like Rena from Higurashi or Eina from Gravion (spelling may be incorrect), and more strong-willed girl voice like Zakuro from Otome Youkai Zakuro. Reimu is more of Zakuro style, I think.

Her other roles include Mai from Mai-Hime, Anna from Godannar series, Date Masamune from Sengoku Otome, Mikuni Reiko from Ookami-san.

- Sawashiro Miyuki-san as Kirisame Marisa

She has very wide range of voice. I don’t really much about her roles. She did Maria from Arakawa, Yomi from BRS, Iwasawa from Angel Beats!, Busujima Saeko from HotD. If you ask me, I think those voices don’t really sound similar.

- Fujimura Ayumi-san as Shameimaru Aya

She also has wide range. (Sorry, it seems everyone is like that.) But I could tell it was Fujimura-san after I found that out and listened carefully, unlike Sawashiro-san.

Few of her notable roles are Eiko from Ika Musume, Iwase from Bakuman, and Knee Shocks from PSG.

- Takahashi Mikako-san as Patchouli Knowledge

To be honest, I haven’t heard of her. So, I’ll just list some of her roles I found on internet: Sairenji Akiho from To Love-Ru, Ryujaki Sakuno from Prince of Tennis, Nishijawa Ayumu from Hayate no Gotoku, and Dakeda Shingen from Sengoku Otome.

- Tanaka Rie-san as Izayoi Sakuya

She did few maid roles, and I think that’s why they (Maikaze) casted her as Sakuya. Her roles include Maria from Hayate no Gotoku, Lacus Klein and Mia Campbell from Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny, Shimazaki from Arakawa, and Chizuru from Ika Musume.

- Tsuji Ayumi-san as Remilia Scarlet

I didn’t really like Remilia’s voice, but that’s maybe Remilia is my favorite character (as you can tell by the fact the first Nendoroid I bought was Remilia) and my standards were too high. But, still. And I didn’t like how they drew her either. Well, I guess I _did_ have too high standards.

So, the one Korean website I usually go didn’t have an article about Tsuji-san, and I think she is least known member of the cast, at least in Korea. But don’t worry. I still found roles she did.

Her roles include: Guchuko in Potemayo, Rose Sheedy in Dead Girls and Red Garden, Kozue from Chaos;Head, and whole bunch of anime as **Girl** or **Beautiful Girl C** or things like that for one episode. It does seem like she is least known in the cast.

- Toyosaki Aki-san as Ibuki Suika

Her most well-known role is Hirasawa Yui from K-on. But Touhou anime was before K-on and Yui was like the role that made her popular. Did Maikaze foresee this?

Anyway, after K-on, she had many roles, and some of them are Uiharu Kazari from Railgun, Chaos from Sora no Otoshi Mono, Momo from To Love-Ru, Asumodeus from Umineko, Bonbori from Zakuro, and Shiina Sisuka from Potemayo.

- Inoue Kikuko-san as the narrator, and possible Yakumo Yukari

At the end of the first episode, she says the title of next episode is “Yukari is 17 years old,” but she says she was just kidding after that. But, Inoue-san is the leader of so-called 17-year-old religion, and people think she will do Yukari’s voice. I haven’t seen the trailer for second episode, but maybe it was there. If you’ve seen it, please feel free to comment.

She is also one of the few people I know by kanji name.

Her notable roles include: I-No from Guilty Gear, Virgilia from Umineko, The Boss from MGS 3, and the narrator from Potemayo.

I didn’t used any pictures for this post, because I thought I was using too much space that this blog has. Plus, I felt like if I insert one picture, there’s gonna be so many of them, and more than half of the post will be pictures since there were more people than I usually post, and they are already long enough, if not too long.

My intention was not to get into too much detail. It was just to see who’s in the Touhou anime, because I think it’s interesting to notice professionals in non-professional works.

PS: I just beat Touhou Castlevania, and it also has professional seiyuus, so I’ll do more of this kind.

PS2: I’m really sorry to take over the first post, Gene, but I really wanted to do this. I almost finished before you did, but I had to do some things and stuff… If it makes you feel any better, I’ve been thinking whether I should post this or not for few days. I’m sorry again.
