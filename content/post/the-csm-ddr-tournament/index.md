The Colorado School of Mines Dance Dance Revolution tournament, hosted by the Anime Club, was yesterday.  Unfortunately, we were hidden away in Ballroom E, but we still had a good turnout I think: 8 people in the Heavy division and 7 people in Light.  Not everything went as originally planned.  The song list went from DDR Supernova 2 from the PS2 to all DDR songs to DDR and ITG to almost anything (Gee and World Is Mine heh).  Also, the Heavy tournament was changed to double elimination.  Still, I think (hope) everyone had a good time.  Results after the break…

Unfortunately the left pad wasn’t working very well during the placement songs, so some of the scores might have been affected.

[Some videos from the tournament](http://www.youtube.com/user/DdRMaSTeRDan#grid/user/550CE649C5357D76)

Light: 1st – Chris L., 2nd – Grant, 3rd – Chaeha, 4th – Gene.  Top 3 got some tissues from Japan, so if they were upset about the prize, at least they had something to cry into.

Heavy: 1st – Daniel E., 2nd – Bryce, 3rd – Daniel P. (me), 4th – Sara.  2nd and 3rd got figurines, and 1st got [Mouning Leskyuu!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD-_oLjmCGY) Oh, and $32.

PS: I guess I’ll try and become a regular weekend poster on this blog, so expect something new after every weekend! (unless I don’t have any ideas or am busy with other stuff or…)
