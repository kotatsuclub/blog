            "Content": "I suppose I wasn’t really there either, seeing as it was done by the time I got out of class, but apparently all that was shown was an abridged version of all of the AMV Hells (save for 0). I usually don’t watch AMVs (for the same reason I don’t read fanfiction), but I do run into a good one here and there by recommendation.\n\nMost well-made AMV I’ve seen in recent memory is this one ( [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQtr4VPfiRA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQtr4VPfiRA)), recommended to me by a friend who is a huge fan of Eureka Seven.\n\nOther than that, hope everyone does well on finals, and hope to see everyone next semester. I’ll make sure to put something up here at some point during break ^\\_^"
