It feels weird for me to make this post since I wasn’t even at this showing (I had a good excuse, I swear), but since no one else has put anything up I guess I’ll go ahead and assume it’s kosher for now.

I wish I had been there; I can’t exactly comment on what was shown, but I’m not exactly a good authority on AMVs. I guess I hope [Children of Daicon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naZColt080) was shown, though, since that’s one of my recent favorites. I can’t really say why. First saw it at the same con I saw [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zYrYkbrGY&feature=related) at, though, which I know was shown on zombie night; I wonder if it made it back into the show on Wednesday?

Most AMVs don’t impress me too much, so maybe it’s a good thing I didn’t make it to the showing, but those two I think are pretty cool.

To my understanding the plan was to show Matt’s abridged version of AMV Hell 5 (right? 5?), and I had seen a significant bit of that on a previous meeting post-showing, and that was pretty good, so… I don’t know… I guess I could talk about that. Or I would if I had much to say about AMVs. This is a pretty pathetic post, come to think of it.

So hopefully someone a bit more AMV-savvy than I can contribute some discussion to the post? Please?

Anyways, until next time! And since that was the last showing of the semester, I guess that means next semester. Time for me to go ~~watch more Bokurano or maybe Spice and Wolf~~ study for finals.
