            "Content": "When I read the summary for IoKoto my first thought was “so it’s Usagi Drop … but less artsy?” When we watched it, it was (IMO) Usagi Drop, but less artsy. Maybe it’s just my American sensibilities speaking, but having loli fanservice (even as subdued as it was) alongside a (supposedly) heartwarming story of adoption just doesn’t work. Too much cognitive dissonance there for me.\n\nI just noticed MC-kun is using his left leg in the poster. How apropos.\n\nEven though I have no interest in a show about soccer, watching the first three episodes was worth it for the LOLDEEP symbolism of the heart transplant and the LOLWUT awesomeness of the ball-through-windshield scene.\n\nAno Natsu seemed interesting enough. Unfortunately, it just lacked a good “hook” for me. I wish it had come off better, since as it is it’s going on my “Should Watch (but Probably Won’t)” list. It’s pretty high up there (probably due to the vague thematic and stylistic similarities to AnoHana, as you point out), though, so maybe it’ll get a chance this summer.\n\nPainfully pun-filled evening? Hmm, what did we watch that week . . .\n\n\\\u003e\\\u003e Angel’s Egg\n\n\\\u003e\\\u003e VOTOMS\n\n\\\u003e\\\u003e BRS\n\n. . . hah. That’ll be a fun review."
