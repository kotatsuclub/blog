First, a few Japanese fighting games: Phantom Breaker is coming out June 2nd on Xbox 360 in Japan.  It’s kind of funny that Kurisu Makise is a guest character (see 1:14 in [the PV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIHeS_PX6_U)), considering that we just watched Steins;Gate.  Ougon Musoukyoku (the Umineko fighting game) is also coming out on the Japanese Xbox 360 (we all have one of those, right?).  Then there’s Aquapazza, featuring characters from To Heart and Utawarerumono, and other series too.  [The first of 4 trailer videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdo7vbUyB0).

Blazblue Continuum Shift II, which will update the console version to the arcade version, is being released in May as free downloadable content.  The character Platinum will be $8 to download.  Tsubaki is better and Litchi’s worse in the arcade version, right?  Because my brother uses Litchi and I use Tsubaki hehe…  Finally, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition comes out as $15 DLC on June 7th for people who already own Super Street Fighter 4.  I’ve been playing it a lot recently, but I’m not that good at it yet.  I’m always up for a match though.
