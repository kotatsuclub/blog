            "Content": "Bungaku Shoujo movie’s already on the hard drive. We have the 1080p version and we’ll be showing it this coming semester. We only have two episodes of Memoir, and a quick google search tells me that’s all that’s available right now, so I wouldn’t worry too much about not finding the last OVA.\n\nNyarlko isn’t complete yet, but they’ve released something that looks like a [OP PV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imoWdOM6kQk) so far. Subbing is slow on the flash raws but they’re out there. Commie subbed one because they’re a bunch of trolls but hopefully they’ll release more as they become available.\n\nI don’t know enough about the game yet either, but there are rumors that besides whatever platform its on, it’ll also see a release on the iphone/ipad (this is just a guess based on the fact that they’ve released a promotional app for free already). NICE BOAT END? DO WANT.\n\nDon’t forget the PFP on TWGOK, that made me laugh a bit.\n\nWe don’t have Tamayura on the HD, but I’ll look into adding it here pretty soon. We have all 26 eps of To Love-Ru already, but not all 12 of Motto- downloaded yet. Maybe I’ll do it, I dunno. Not a big fan of the series (except Hanazawa-san is pretty great in episode 11 of Motto).\n\nGod I’d love to go to summer comiket. Great list for having stuff not on Chris’ or mine list. Despite saying you’re not good at this sort of thing it was an enjoyable read, past the silly errors here and there. 🙂"

            "Content": "11? Heresy! \\*conveniently ignoring the fact my lazy ass only had 7\\*\n\nVery interesting list-not only have I not seen a lot of it, I haven’t even heard of some of it. I agree about depicting everyday life-I think it’s important to watch shows like that, because it brings us back to earth and reminds us that amazing things happen in normal life, too.\n\nKuroneko beats Kirno anyday. I am completely in favor of a Kuroneko end. Angel Beats game? Sign me up, hopefully it’s for the PC. Maybe I should look into learning Japanese…\n\nLol at the amount of Hanazawa Kana-san, though I’m definitely not knocking you for it. She’s an excellent VA, and she’s quickly becoming one of my favorites (not to mention she seems to be in everything lately).\n\nAs for your “mental illness”…I wouldn’t call it an illness per se, just an, eh, infatuation. It’s perfectly fine to be a big fan of someone, but be careful about turning them into someone they’re not. Remember the idealized Hanazawa-san of your dreams is probably not the Hanazawa-san of reality. Ask yourself what it is, exactly, that draws you to her. If it’s her skill as a seiyuu, or the characters she voices, I would advise you to separate those things from her actual persona (there are plenty of people I respect for their abilities that I would never want to eat lunch with). If it’s her actual personality/appearance, there are plenty of other girls like her. You’ll find someone better, and closer to home; I’m sure of it.\n\nHope you have a great New Year’s (I’m getting my wisdom teeth pulled tomorrow, so I’ll probably spend it in pain T\\_T). And if you’re ever feeling down, we’re here for you (I am, at least). If you need to talk, I’m all ears.",

                    "Content": "The thing is, living in a dream kinda became part of my life already, to the point where I would actually call it an illness. I’ve been like that since when I was in elemantary school, or even before that. It’s not limited to this kind of symptoms either. It’s just that I always live in my own little world. This time it just happened to be meeting Hanazawa-san. Sometimes it’s making so much money, winning something, and stuff like that.\n\nI think I’m a little ill (I’m serious) but very little that I’m not classified as one. I think if it was a little more, they’d tell me I’m a bipolar. I get depressed for no reason, and next minute I’m happy for no reason. But it’s okay, I guess. There are people worse than me, and I’m thankful that I’m not that bad. And I’ve lived like this so long, I think I made peace with this. Usually I’d write this in diary, but for some reason I left it on the Mines Park, and I hope no one reads it.\n\nAlso, that’s how I decided to become a writer. I don’t know how this will sound, but I don’t really write. It’s like I’m there, and I just record whatever I see. (Well, I _am_ there. It’s that I can’t get out of it is the problem) I thought “it’d be a waste if no one knew about the world I’m seeing right now.” you know. Whenever I close my eyes and concentrate, I can see it. It’s hard to explain, I guess.\n\nAnyway, thanks to me who always escape reality to world I want, when I was, like, 4 or 5, I didn’t like how one anime turned out to be. So I made it my own way, and I don’t think I watched it much after that. It was not very different, but it was how I wanted it. Now I have my own characters, places, background story, and things like that. I guess not everything about my issue is bad. This also helped me distinguish between reality and fiction, despite what you may think. I myself don’t know how or why, but it is true.\n\nOh, and my wisdom teeth are growing. I can see one of them poking out. I thought I could leave it alone if it doesn’t hurt, but my mom said it’s good idea to pull it out no matter what. I hope you are okay.\n\nAnd thanks for worrying about me. I feel much better now, and I’m okay. Don’t worry about me.",

Assuming you didn’t make a typo, you should go find ep 4 :3\n\nThis is a lovely list, and I’m very happy to see someone who enjoyed Black Rock Shooter so much since it warranted a lot of unnecessary negative attention for no reason, in spite of being quite good. I’ve got it on DVD now thanks to it being thrown in with the BRS figma and nendoroid releases.\n\nI’d reply further, but I have my own 2010 anime review to speak for me~\n\n[http://myswordisunbelievablydull.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/2010-anime-review/](http://myswordisunbelievablydull.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/2010-anime-review/)",
