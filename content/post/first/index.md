Hello everyone!

This is the first blog post on the new CSMAC blog (BIG WHUP!). This blog will be for the anime club officers to post about whatever they’re doing/watching/playing, because I’m sure everyone is absolutely ENTHRALLED and waiting on the edge of their seat to see what the heck their crazed officers are up to (heaven forbid).

In the future, check here for updates in what’s going on in the anime world. This will not be the place to check for what we plan on showing at regular meetings (6:00 PM on Wednesdays~) but perhaps to discuss what happens during or afterward. I’ll be updating this as frequently as I am able, and hopefully my other officers will spread the love as well.

LOOK FORWARD TO IT!!
