I am posting on the blog because I was asked to, and because the showings just aren’t enough.\n\nI’m not really sure what I should be saying but it’s pretty darn sweet that the club has its own blog now, and an awesome Arakawa banner to boot…\n\nI guess I’d just like to say again that I’m excited as all get out for Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. I loved the first season and the second was… good… I guess. Cough. But yeah. Looking forward to Asahina’s PLOT YOU KNOW WHAT I’M SAYIN’."
