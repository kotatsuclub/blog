So funny joke, we ended rather early. Wonder why? Apparently I scheduled Black Rock Shooter to be shown tonight as well. I think I can safely blame the Dayquil for that mishap. Altogether a great showing with a few moments with lots of PLOT (see above). Arakawa proves time and again that characters really drive the show, not necessarily the PLOT.

In case you weren’t there for the nonsense after, I mentioned that there’s an “official” touhou “anime” coming out soon, which you should [check out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2cPk1196xY).  Also announced last week was the remastering of “Berserk,” which I also highly recommend. I believe we have the dub/sub dual audio rip on the hard drive. If not, then I might have accidentally the whole thing.

On the way home, I was trolled by my own vice president, God damn him. I forgot a CERTAIN MEMBER’S name, so I thought I would do the polite thing and ask people until I found out his name, without actually asking his name in person, because he’s been to every showing since I was a freshman, paid dues every semester since we started (which was last semester, lulz), and has been in my room on several occasions. I ask Matt this, and the first thing that happens is his insane driver reflex kicks in, he pulls a u-turn into the parking lot where SAID MEMBER was getting into his car, and rolls down the passenger side window. Pulled up, told him Chris wanted to know his name. I then yelled at Matt for 10 minutes. I don’t think I’ve ever been trolled that hard in a while.

His name’s Alex, by the way. Next showing will be Disappearance with more Arakawa. THEN we’ll show BRS the week after.
