And I feel so relieved. So I had this urge to write something because I’m so excited about it! (and something else that you’ll see later.)

Since I’m a big Eva fan, I think I’ll write about it. Eva has so many things to discuss anyway.

Before going in deep, this may be spoilers, so if you want to see the whole Eva series, skip it.

When we had Eva showing, I heard some people (sorry. I don’t remember who they were) saying something that kind of implies Eva new movies are continuation from EoE (End of Eva)

I personally don’t believe it, no offence to whoever believing it, but I’ll support both sides to be fair.

For those of you who don’t know what I’m talking about, there’s a theory saying that new Eva movies are not new, but it’s happening sometime later EoE. In other words, it’s a loop like Higurashi.

So, evidence 1: Anno’s saying.

Anno one day said that Eva is a “repeating story.” Some people think it means that the new movies are looping from EoE. But he also said that he’s going to make new movies enjoyable even if you don’t know the old series. So, if it was actually a loop, then he wouldn’t say like that.

Evidence 2: the red sea.

It is left like that at the end of EoE is what people are saying. But this was proved wrong in the second movie. It mentions that the sea was blue before the 2nd Impact. The damage in new movies may have been just bigger than the TV series.

Evidence 3: a trace of a giant in the first movie.

Some people say it’s the old Angel of Eva, but there is not enough evidence.

Evidence 4: Eva-01 didn’t save Shinji from falling rock.

In the TV series, before Shinji got on Eva-01, it saved him from falling rocks. But the Eva-01 with Yui’s (Shinji’s mom) soul is now in space (in EoE), so the new Eva-01 does not have Yui’s soul, and that’s why it didn’t save Shinji. But, sadly, this theory was denied in the second movie.

Evidence 5: the ruin in the first movie.

It is ruin from 3rd Impact in EoE. VS. Anno just had more budget.

This can go either way.

Evidence 6: the blood on the moon.

It may be Lilith’s blood.

But, then we can see it from earth too since the blood was also sprayed on the front side. It can be from the Eva they are making on the moon.

Evidence 7: the Nerv logo.

It has old logo, so they must be using the old Nerv building. VS. It’s just new design. The “old part” is different from the actual old logo from TV series.

Evidence 8: Kaworu’s lines.

His lines imply that it’s not the first time Kaworu’s meeting Shinji. But, this doesn’t mean this is from the old movie. It can mean that they’ve met in the new movies.

Shinji became Adam in EoE (Shinji’s soul was used to make Adam) and since Kaworu has Adam’s soul, this may refer to that.

There’s also funny thing about “Pleased to meet you, Father.” Father (otou-san) can mean both father and father-in-law, so maybe he was going to take Shinji as his bride (JK)

There are more evidences (or something you can say evidences without certainty) if you try to look for. I think there are enough evidences to support both sides, so it’s up to you which one you believe. I personally don’t believe the loop theory just because I don’t want it to be like that.

And finally, I can brag about this. My Nendoroid and three Amagami singles! They just came today. I’ve been waiting so long!

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/Photo_00001.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/Photo_00001.jpg" caption="Sorry, I don&#39;t have a camera, so I used my laptop&#39;s webcam. " width="640" height="480">}}

This was the other reason why I’m so happy right now. I so wanna open it right now, but at the same time, I wanna keep it like this forever.

P.S : I have my own theory about the two remaining movies. They are going to be released at the same time, so here’s what I think about it. Maybe, it’s like two short movies in on movie, like how EoE had two “episodes.” And the 3rd one is called Q, which refers to Quickening. It was 急 (pronounced as “kyuu”) before, which means the same thing. It can be used like this: 急展開 (kanjis may differ because what I wrote are Korean kanjis) which means “quick story advancing” Do you know how they put so much in few episodes in Higurashi and Umineko? Something like that can be described as 急展開. So, I think the 3rd movie will be a really short one before the 4th one, and 4th one start right after.

But it’s all theory, and I’m not even really positive, but it’s Anno. I can never guess what the hell is going in his brain.
