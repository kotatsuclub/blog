            "Content": "No matter how many times I watch Eva I still wat.\n\nThere are times when i think that the rebuild movies are after EoE, but most of the time I think they are gainax saying “LOLSORRYDIRECTORMENTALLYILL… HERE’S SOME COOL ANIMATION TO MAKE UP FOR IT”\n\nSo it would be like how Brotherhood is to the first FMA anime, but less of a difference. IE, the same stuff happens but the details are different. Either way, EVA is one of my favorite series of all time and I can’t wait for the final two rebuild movies."

            "Content": "Really interesting article! I personally love Evangelion, but this is all really new theory to me since I never really watched the rebuild movies, and the 2.22 showing a few weeks back was my first exposure to the rebuild.\n\nI suppose it could go either way or not, in terms of it being a loop. I actually wouldn’t mind it being a continuation of EoE… I mean, sort of the whole thing happening in the end was that Shinji ended up with an opportunity to shape the world, yeah? So it could have happened like that–it’s just that there’s no reason it would be reshaped to be so similarly to the original, considering how unsatisfied he was.\n\nThat said, I don’t really have any ideas, so I don’t want to make my own theory. It might just be too early to say, but I don’t think I would mind if it was just a loop scenario. At this point, I’ll probably end up being interested no matter what happens. Some of the ‘evidence’ for the loop does sound a bit far-fetched, though.\n\nAt the end, though, it could really just be what it looks like at first glance: a re-imagining of the original series with a larger budget and certain tweaks. The Evangelion manga is kind of the same way. Overall it’s similar, but with some differences here and there. I’m looking forward to the rest of it."

            "Content": "Don’t hate me, but i didn’t think that Eva was that great of an anime. it might have been the seizure inducing shrink session in the end, or the fact that shinji is a pussy the entire series, or whatever, but it does not rank in the top tier of the anime’s i have seen. the first movies (EoE and D\u0026R) improved my impression a bit though.\n\nThat being said, i thought the rebuilds (1.0 and 2.0) were insanely awesome and can’t wait for the rest. maybe its just the insanity catching up to me, but i thought the rebuilds (so far) took out all the parts in the original Eva series that i disliked and fixed them. so for any of you hesistant about watching the rebuild, don’t be.\n\nalso the game."
