We’re watching it, so here’s its spot.  Watching episodes 5 and 6 this week; if you need to get caught up, read Matt’s review from last week [here](http://minesblog.com/anime/2011/10/02/i-am-the-bone-of-this-blog/).

I don’t know anything about this show, but Gene says we’re showing it.  This movie was produced by Studio Ghibli and premiered last July.  Here’s part of the synopsis from wikipedia:

The story takes place in 2010 in Koganei, western Tokyo and like the novel revolves around a group of “tiny people” who are 10 cm tall and live under the floorboards of a typical human household.

A boy named Shō arrives at the house his mother lived in as a child, to live with his great aunt Sadako. When Shō leaves the car, he sees a cat trying to attack something in the bushes, but the cat leaves after being attacked by a crow. Shō goes to see what the cat was trying to attack. He then sees a Borrower named Arrietty.

Hopefully more people show up than last week, but then lol exams.  Member dues are $2 for the semester and give you access to the club library and pay for pizza and soda next week =D.  No member dues, no pizza.  I’m kind of a Nazi when it comes to determining who gets pizza, so member dues if you want some; ve haf vays of traking you.  We still have Ramune for $1.50 for those so inclined.

We’ll see you on Wednesday, bring your friends!
