            "Content": "I wanted to watch that movie! Although I’d want to watch Taketori Monogatari more which is also by Ghibli and was announced to be released at the same time as Arrietty first, then I don’t think it was released at that time. Then I never heard of any news about it other than “to be released 2010.” I’m not even sure if it’s out or canceled. I guess Kaguya Hime is not so much popular now. Or at least in Korea, because I didn’t really check non-Korean websites for the news. If anyone knows what happened to it, let me know."

So I guess that gives everyone another week to pay dues. Fuck school, watch anime, etc."
