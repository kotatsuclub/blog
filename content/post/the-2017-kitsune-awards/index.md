Good God on a bicycle, 2017 is finally coming to a close. 

It's about damn time.

For me, 2017 was a year of just straight stress and busywork. This was the year I graduated, got my thesis work queued up, sent off a PhD application, and finally understood how it felt to have close to zero free time. Meanwhile, tempers kept flaring up over politics, net neutrality has been voted to be killed off by the FCC, the movies this year were meh, the music was not all that much better save for a couple of bright spots, and compared to the utterly amazing blowout of a year that was 2016 for anime, this year was nowhere near as spectacular.

And while I happen to love ripping into bad shows with the voraciousness of a starved wolf being let into a pet food store on accident, I'm going to save that for a later article. I like ending years on as positive a note as I can, and today we're going to do that by recognizing what are, in my opinion, the best shows to have been released in 2017. The categories are arbitrary, the points don't matter, and I'm probably going to contradict myself in regards to what I said about some of these shows before. Either way, put on your best formal wear, have a seat, pop the champagne, and prepare to clap for fifteen minutes on end as we begin The 2017 Kitsune Awards (because foxes are awesome).

Before we dig into the awards proper, let's quickly go over my criteria for the shows I'm selecting. First off, I'm using MAL's seasonal list for all of these awards; if a show's on the list for any of the four seasons of 2017, then its hat is considered to be in the ring for the purposes of awards. I'm also going to be excluding any long-running shows and sequels from contention (except for one obvious category). 

So on that note, let's kick things off with:

**BEST COMEDY: MISS KOBAYASHI'S DRAGON MAID**

*Honorable Mentions: Gabriel Dropout, KonoSuba 2, Food Wars! Season 3*

**BEST ROMANCE: NET-JUU NO SUSUME**

*Honorable Mentions: Pretty much everything not Eromanga-san, Netsuzou or Hajimete*

**BEST ACTION: AKASHIC RECORDS OF BASTARD MAGICAL INSTRUCTOR**

**BEST ANIMATION: KAKEGURUI**

**BEST SEQUEL: MY HERO ACADEMIA SEASON 2**

*Honorable Mentions: Attack on Titan 2, KonoSuba 2*

**BEST SHOW INVOLVING A SCHOOL: TSUREDURE CHILDREN**

*Honorable Mentions: Little Witch Academia*

**BEST SHOW I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WATCH: MAHOUJIN GURUGURU**

**BEST FILM: YOUR NAME**

**BEST IN SHOW: THE ANCIENT MAGUS' BRIDE**
