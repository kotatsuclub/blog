Somebody call the hospital.

This part of the semester is probably my favorite part of the entire year. Halloween is this weekend, generally giving adults and children alike a reason to dress up as something ridiculous.

I’m also excited because our annual semester showing of DISTURBIA NIGHT is coming up next wednesday, and I’m proud to announce the shows we’ll be presenting (kept a secret, more or less, up until now):

- Dai Mahou Touge
- Shi Ki
- Narutaru

It should prove to be an absolutely frightening evening! I can’t promise pizza for this showing because Domino’s wasn’t feelin’ like doing that twice a semester. I was thinking we might do the group trip out to Chipotle again though, would anyone be interested in driving people out there at around 5:30?

Speaking of Chipotle, their free burritos are $2 this year, and you have to dress up as a condiment. That means no more wrapping yourself in tinfoil and getting a free burrito. It was also recently discovered that every chipotle is requiring people to dress up as something different, thereby preventing “chipotle hopping” which happens so often on halloween. For example, the Chipotle near DU is requiring people to come as a processed food.

If you’re going to be FOREVER ALONE ;\_; this Halloween, I’ll be at my place doing another run-through of Amnesia for nostalgia’s sake. Either that or watching anime. You’re all invited, but I only have so much room on my couch. Fiji still has leftover root beer from their event last friday.

Remember to be safe this Halloween.
