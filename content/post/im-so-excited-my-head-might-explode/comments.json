            "Content": "I was considering bringing a cosplay back, but it seemed like too much work to do that for a single night where I may not even leave my room, so instead I’m sticking with a Sgt. Pepper’s jacket and some tinted glasses…\n\nI’m also looking forward to next week, since from what everyone says it seems like these showings are all a lot of fun. And I haven’t seen any of the anime that are showing, so that probably makes it better.\n\nAlso, seeing that clip of Amnesia and hearing it described that one night post-showing made me intrigued enough to eventually purchased it. But then I got to the prison, started crying, and stopped playing. I’ll get back to it some day, though… Stopping by to spectate might be fun, though, haha."

            "Content": "LOL 100th\n\nI haven’t really seen Shiki, but since everyone I’ve talked to that’s seen it basically orgasms when it’s mentioned, I assume it’s good.\n\nNever heard of Dai Mahou Touge. After a quick look on Wikipedia, though, it looks like it has an amusing premise, and an interesting voice cast.\n\nNarutaru…um. Yeah. I, uh, hmm. I’ll just stop now.\n\nI’ll definitely be up for watching Amnesia again. No Circuits homework this week FTW."
