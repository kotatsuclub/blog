It’s winter break, and I got nothing to do. Except checking out animes that Hanazawa-san was in, of course. Now I finally have time to watch everything featuring her.

If you’re thinking, “Wait, haven’t you done her already?” the answer is yes. BUT, I’m such a big fan. It’s my duty to keep posting about her. Also, I checked my previous post, and it was combined with Asumi-san, other seiyuu named Kana I know. So, this time, it’s going to be all about Hanazawa-san.

<!--more-->

Her debut as seiyuu was in 2003, but she was a child actress before that.

Her first major work as seiyuu was in 2006.

I haven’t watched those, so I can’t tell you anything about them.

Since she did so many roles, I won’t be talking much about each character. Rather, I will be talking about how Hanazawa-san’s so cute in each role she did.

First up is Sengoku Nadeko. She was the girl associated with snake in Bakemonogatari. There’s a joke about that. She plays MSX and the game she plays is the original Metal Gear.

I haven’t watched Bakemonogatari, but her OP is so cute. I guess it’s what they call “tore” (apparently it’s something more that moe. If you’ve see/read Bakemonogatari, I think you’ll understand.) So I’ll post some links of parodies and stuff I liked most.

Man, that was a lot. That’s how much I like the OP I guess.

Next is Kuroneko.

She is that Chuu ni byou (中二病. It’s kinda hard to explain with my limited Japanese-English skill, but Mazui translated it as teen complex. It’s kinda like emo I guess.) kid from Ore Imo.

Next is Tachibana Kanade from Angel Beats!

At first she seemed like a cool-dere character like Yuki from Haruhi series. But then she turned out to be the true heroin. Her every move is just so cute, and I fear it will be too long to list them all, so I’ll end it here.

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/12/79d6f3bd11029ec5f54a93ad9d6a3013-300x220.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/12/79d6f3bd11029ec5f54a93ad9d6a3013.jpg" caption="Tachibana Ruri(Kuroneko&#39;s real name) and Gokou(Kuroneko&#39;s real family name) Kanade" width="300" height="220">}}

Now, time for Shiomiya Shiori from World God Only Knows.

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/12/e0008488_4d117920be67d-297x300.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/12/e0008488_4d117920be67d.jpg" width="297" height="300">}}

She is a literature girl like Yuki. Her super high tension baka/aho combo is a must-to-listen if you are a fan like me. I thought I died from too much moe there.

I think it’s interesting because Hanazawa-san already did a literature girl in Bungaku Shoujo, literally meaning literature girl. She was also in Amagami SS for a cameo appearance as the Bungaku Shoujo. I think I mentioned that in the previous post.

Last but not least, but also a rumor. I haven’t confirmed it, but apparently Hanazawa-san also performs as Remilia Scarlet in Anime Tenchou X Touhou Project. Hanazawa-san as Remi? Hell yeah! It’s like… There’s not enough words to express my thoughts. I hope that’s true.

Things to buy now, all done by Hanazawa Kana-san.
