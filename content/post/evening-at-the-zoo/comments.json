You also usually notice how the animation and music are telling part of the story, something I tend to miss. That faces bit in Usagi Drop was particularly interesting. And one of these days, I’ll remember to pick up Penguindrum.\n\nNext time for Rubik’s Cubes, pirates without hats, and cheating. Can’t wait."
