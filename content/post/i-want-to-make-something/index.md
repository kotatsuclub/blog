I really want to make something and I feel like my life would be wasted we I don’t.

I tried various things, and liked most of them, but didn’t continue anything.

Then I saw [this guy’s Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/kmiyata1013a), and I thought I want to do something like that.

So here’s what I did. [Attempt to Rolling Girl orchestra arrange](http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/09/rolling-girl-classic.mid), only the intro. I know it sucks, but hey, I’m not a pro, and I’m using General Midi. Man, I really wish I had some good sound library.

Then I saw [this](http://www.garritan.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=154&Itemid=54), and now I want a job.
