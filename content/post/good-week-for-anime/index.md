I was originally gonna post about anime I didn’t like, but then this whole week happened, and now I’m in a good mood.

# A Quick Word about Narutaru

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/1289068849208-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/11/1289068849208.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}

I think just about everyone who was at the showing this past week has asked for or just finished downloading the rest of Narutaru. I guess I should be glad about this, but remember to be careful when showing it to your friends. More appropriately, be careful showing it to your enemies. In fact, don’t show it to anyone BUT your enemies. For the rest of you, the violence peaks at about episode 11. Also READ THE MANGA.

On another Narutaru related note, I managed to find a similar trollshow with a similar troll opening. I couldn’t find a place to download it anywhere, so I ended up buying it. For 44 cents. For the rest of you, check out your local library. I know you’ll find it there as well. The other two shows we’ll be featuring for disturbia night next semester have been picked out as well, one of them is new, the other is… kinda new (actually its very old).

# Panty & Stocking

It got awesome again. I was raving when the first episode came out, and right around two weeks ago I was a hair’s length away from dropping it. A lot of terrible jokes and overall cringe-inducing demons really turned me off for episodes 3-5. Then episode 6 came out. If you were at the showing and enjoyed episode 1, just skip right to six and you’ll never know that the series was EVER hit-or-miss. For the sake of one inside joke in six, you might want to watch episode 4…

Gainax’s style for this anime really never misses its mark either. Plot and characterization notwithstanding, the art has been impeccably unique. Credit where credit is due, they’ve never really skimped on an episode in this department yet.

# Shinryaku! Ika Masume

If P&S is hit-or-miss, this show alternates between total poverty and winning the lottery. This week, it won the lottery for the HNNG-inducing part-ep with mini-Ika. Whoever the hell is writing for this show knows how to lower my expectations and then totally exceed my standards. THE MOE, MAN. THE MOE.

# My little sister can’t be this cute!

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Episode 5. This whole show was worth it just for this single episode.

# Thanks for your patience

Matt fixed his sound. Should be fine this week. We’re showing:

- Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin
- Requiem for the Phantom
- Blue Gender

Phantom was something we never got around to doing last semester, so I’m proud that we finally get around to it. Matt wanted to show Blue Gender sometime, so we’ll toss that in too. Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin was on the poster at the beginning of the semester, and its one of my favorites from the Fall season. Hope to see you there!
