That was a long time ago, though, so this time my thoughts might be different. I don’t think I’ve even heard of the other two shows, so that’s exciting.\n\nAnd this post just makes me more curious about ‘My little sister can’t be this cute!’. I still haven’t seen any, but it still looks like an interesting show. Have to grab some sometime!"

Also kiddies, mark your calendars for December 29th; OST date announced =DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!\n\n(FLY AWAY NOW FLY AWAY NOW FLY AWAYYYYYYYYYYYY)\n\nShiki this week made me shit bricks too. I watched episode 14 at 1:30am Friday morning, and I had to watch 1.5 hours of Cowboy Bebop afterwards just to calm down from it. (Can it be thursday again yet?)\n\nI still have Oreimo 6, Yakumo 6, Bakuman 6, Yosuga no Sora 5, and whatever else I’m watching that I can’t think of to watch, so hopefully this week finishes strong.",

Having an actual plot (which, knowing Gainax, will somehow become crazily warped, unless they’ve already used up their Holy Shit Quota) will no doubt help on that.\n\nSquid Girl turned the moe up to 11, but OreImo 6 gives it a run for its money and turns it up to about 10.5. It’s a shame Manami x Kyo can never happen due to the show’s premise.\n\n;\\_;"
