Before I start anything, this is not an awesome post or anything, but the last post was in May. I think the blog will start feel lonely soon if we don’t do anything about it.

However, I don’t think there’s gonna be many people reading this before the school starts, so SURPRISE! Bet you didn’t expect anything after Chris’s post.

Now, that I think of it, I’m doing this more to surprise you than anything. So, the value of the contents of this post close to none, if not zero. But I’m still going to insert more tag, to waste your time just little bit more. Remember I warned you.

So, I got a computer virus, and didn’t lose a single thing except all the settings I had. I was feeling really down, so I didn’t do anything, but I started moving files from my external hard drive to my laptop, and began the process of restoring my old laptop. I mean, I can’t let my Madoka theme go wasted, right?

And I kinda needed music to listen to, and I have almost 200 gig of ONLY TOUHOU MUSIC! I mean, I didn’t think I’d listen to nothing but Touhou. But there are so many of them!

Gene may know this already, but I am collecting Madoka DVDs (sorry I don’t have BD player, but you need to learn to respect the poor), all first press limited edition. I was gonna buy Higurashi Kira, too, but I didn’t get a job like I planned to. I may not be able to buy BRS the game either at this rate. Oh, Madoka, why did you have to be releases this year. If it was a year later, I would be fine. Now, I only need $450 more to buy the thing in my priority list, so anyone wanna donate some money? It’s better to help those who in need right in front of you than someone faraway. (I’m joking. You know that, right?)

Some of you may not like the sound of this, but sometimes, you do need to support what you like. Wait... why is there 2 of volume 1......" width="300" height="168">}}

Okay, that was stupid mistake by me, but it turned out that there was a big recall because of some bugs in the disk and typos (or rather, change in the lyrics of Madoka’s character song) in the booklet, and the two different sellers sent me different versions, and I ended up owning the one with the problems, and one without them. If you are a collector like myself, you will understand that I’m very happy that I made that mistake. God works in strange ways that people can’t understand at times.

What else do I need to say… Oh, yes. So this friend of mine has BlazBlue, and I wanted Platinum so bad that I bought it for him. Well, it was my PSN account, and he’s not that good at that game, so it was basically for me. I mean, he never uses her anyway. Then it showed me a complete additional color pack for 5 bucks! So I bought that too. Well, it was for the other version of BlazBlue. I got mad, and bought all 3 color packs, which was $15 total, just because I was mad. Ah, 20 dollars wasted in less than 3 minutes. Next time you buy something, READ IT CAREFULLY, and don’t be like me.

So, that’s it for now. I’ll have another surprise for you in 2 weeks or so. Well, if anyone reads this, that is. Man, I feel like I’m writing a dying message or something. It feels like, “by the time you read this, I’ll be gone, and I wish that you will shine some light onto this mystery.”

If I sound like a failed troll, that’s probably because of this Korean kid who thinks he’s trolling but not. He sometimes yells “TROOOOOLLLLL!” but I don’t know why. I really wanna ask him if he even knows what trolling means, but then I don’t understand it fully, so I can’t really explain to him. But I know for sure, whenever he yells troll, he is not trolling. Maybe that’s the point. Maybe he’s trolling by saying he’s trolling when he’s not. Hmm, he may be a smarter troll than I thought.

That’s it. I hope I either wasted your time, or surprised you. And I also hope I wasted the last bit of space this blog is allowed. Ha Ha Ha. My evil plan always works!
