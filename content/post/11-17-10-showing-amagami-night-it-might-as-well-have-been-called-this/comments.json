I haven‚Äôt heard much about how it ends so we‚Äôll see if its worth a watch or not. Besides that, I have a lot of other anime to finish, like Garden of Sinners.\n\nAwesome review, thanks for doing them this semester Grant! üòÑ"

            "Content": "Unashamedly, I grabbed Sex Jokes: The Anime. I know I‚Äôll get bored of it at some point, but my expectations for it lie somewhere around ‚Äúmake me laugh for a couple hours.‚Äù It does handle its comedy better than one might expect; the timing on jokes is well executed most of the time.\n\nAmagami was very ‚Ä¶ average, I guess I could say. In a good way, though. I couldn‚Äôt find anything particularly engrossing/unique to the show, but it still held my attention. I suspect I‚Äôll come back to it once I ~~run out of~~ get bored of Sex Jokes: The Anime. Might be a good thing to watch over Christmas break.\n\nHoFL. Hmm. I suspect I couldn‚Äôt get into it because of the slowness you mentioned, and it couldn‚Äôt have helped that I was feeling tired by that point, either (then I broke out my laptop and my attention was totally gone). I can totally dig the art style, though; I love shows that go for a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù sort of look (Tatami Galaxy, FLCL, Katanagatari, etc).\n\nRelatedly, I heartily recommended Samurai Champloo to anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen it yet. Hip-Hop Samurai Anachronism Mashup. Very fun.",
