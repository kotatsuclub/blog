Hey, everyone! It is I, Grant, and this post is happening again. This week we watched Seitokai Yukuindomo (which I believe has also been referred to as Sex Jokes: The Show), Amagami-SS, and The House of Five Leaves. Feel free to discuss them below.

The first show, Seitokai Yukuindomo, was funny. That’s all I can really think to say about it. I doubt I’ll be watching more, but I would be lying if I said it didn’t make me laugh here and there. The apparently one-dimensional aspect of the comedy probably wouldn’t hold my attention for all that long. I just forsee that Tsuda and what’s-her-face eventually get together after wading through a sea of bad jokes (which I will still laugh at). Then everyone lives happily ever after and more sex jokes are made. Or something. Anyway, if you enjoy this kind of comedy, this show should be a no-brainer.

Second was Amagami-SS. From what I could tell, it seemed that Gene liked this show, so I was hoping for good things from this show. As someone who had neither played the games nor looked up summaries elsewhere, though, I expected a pretty standard romantic comedy. I daresay it exceeded any expectation I could have had, though. In a way, it really IS just a standard romantic comedy, but there’s something about the girls that makes them likable, and Tachibana was unexpectedly kind of a clever guy. The show was, like the first one, hilarious, only instead of falling back on sex jokes for the humor, it used the quirks of the girls in the story. And I definitely did LOL; I had to wipe tears from my eyes after a particular scene. It also really makes me want to play the game…

Third was House of Five Leaves. I think I overheard someone saying it was kind of a boring show, and I can sort of see why one would think that: it’s much slower paced and less ‘exciting’ than a show like Amagami. Everything in the show seemed handled in a more ‘matter-of-fact’ fashion. Actually, what this show really made me want to do was go and watch Samurai Champloo, because this show had–what?–one single action scene that was about three seconds long, and not that thrilling at that? Aside from that, the art style is also definitely something unique–they all really do look like frogs when the camera looks head-on… And I actually thought that the general premise was interesting. I wouldn’t be surprised if I went ahead and watched more of this sometime. I don’t like its disco ED much though…

That’s everything I have to say. I’m going to go watch the fourth episode of Amagami now. I hope you go ahead and discuss!
