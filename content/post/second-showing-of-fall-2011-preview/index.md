Greetings peons, VP Steve here with a preview of the CSM Anime Club showing on 9/7/2011.  As always, we’ll be in Berthoud Hall 241 and the showing starts at 6:00 P.M.

**Hidan no Aria**

The first show of the night will be Hidan no Aria.  This anime was produced by J.C. Staff and aired this past spring.  I have not seen this show (because lol jcstaff), so the rest of this synopsis is taken from http://www.myanimelist.net.  The story takes place in Tokyo Butei High School, a special school where armed detectives — “Butei” — are trained to use weapons. Kinji Tooyama is a second-year-student who has a special ability, but he keeps it a secret to maintain an ordinary, peaceful life. However, when he gets caught in a bombing on the way to school, he encounters H. Aria Kanzaki, the most powerful S-Rank Butei student in Assault Studies.

**Ano Hana (aka Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, aka DAT FLOWER)**

The second show of the evening will be Ano Hana.  Ano Hana was another anime from this past spring, but unlike Aria, I watched this one.  The story focuses around a group of childhood friends that are now in high school.  These friends have grown apart and gone their separate ways after a tragedy befell their group.  The show focuses on how each character deals with and eventually comes to terms with this tragedy.  As someone who watched this anime as it was airing, I have to say this show is worth watching all the way through, and it will be available on the club hard drives for those who have paid member dues for the semester.

**Legend of Legendary Heroes**

… need I say more?  IT’S LEGENDARY YO!

Our final show on Wednesday will be Legend of Legendary heroes.  Again from myanimelist.net: Ryner Lute is a lazy student of the Roland Empire Royal Magician’s Academy. One day, the Roland Empire goes to war against their neighboring country Estabul, and Ryner loses his classmates in the war. After the war, Ryner sets out on a journey to search the relics of a “Legendary Hero” at King Sion Astal’s command and finds out that a deadly curse is spreading throughout the continent.

I hope you guys are looking forward to this showing as much as I am.  We had 57 people sign up for the mailing list at Celebration of Mines, so I hope we see lots of the new recruits on Wednesday.

As always, member dues are $2.00 for the semester and $1.50 will get you a Ramune.  Remember, member dues get you access to the club library and pay for pizza and soda, so if you’re not already a member, join Wednesday!

I hope you guys enjoyed this preview, I plan on doing one of these for each showing this semester.  Feedback is welcome.
