            "Content": "Powerful list there Chris I sure do love K-On!! laughinganimeclub.jpg\n\nBut no seriously I watched K-On 2 as well. Did not regret but did not enjoy either. Sora No Woto was pretty good, obv. canâ€™t recommend it to EVERYone but I mean, it wasnâ€™t horrifying either. Listen to me, no wonder Iâ€™m awful.\n\nRailgun was def. better than Index, canâ€™t say it was better than the first two arcs of Index but definitely overall better than Index. If anything it was far less ADD than Index and had plenty of Misaka and that trollface Saten. Whatâ€™s Uiharuâ€™s ability? I forget. ðŸ™‚\n\nDefinitely a really solid list. Canâ€™t really kill you on the first two, seeing as I watched them too. Brotonashi fo shoâ€™.\n\nAAAAAAAAAA SQUID GIRL",

                    "Content": "Uiharu revealed her (Level 1) ability was to keep taiyaki warm. Most popular theories to her power is temperature control and entropy stop (which are kinda related, anyway). Either way, level 5 possibilities are ridiculously broken, and either would allow her to commit mass genocide (both allow her to completely stop all physical processes in a space of arbitrary size). Actually, half of me wonders if she could even overcome Toumaâ€™s Imagine Breaker by simply reducing the environment to absolute zero temperature."

            "Content": "Well, Iâ€™d say I think your list is good, butâ€“like with Geneâ€™sâ€“Iâ€™ve only seen part of it. In fact, Iâ€™ve really only seen Angel Beats! and the Tatami Galaxy on this list. So I canâ€™t say anything about the list, but it seemed put together pretty well, sure! And it was fun to read. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve seen enough of K-On to count it.\n\nOf course, quite excited to see The Tatami Galaxy in first place! And that Disappearance got a good feature.\n\nLike I said, though, good read despite not having seen most of the shows. Looks like there are a handful I really need to grab sometime.\n\nLittle tidbit about squid girl isâ€¦ kind of ridiculous, but I guess thatâ€™s why itâ€™s worth posting. I might have to go back and watch the show in the impossibly unlikely case where the studio adopts this fan theory."
