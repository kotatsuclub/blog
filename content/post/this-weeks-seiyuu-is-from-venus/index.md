It seems that the way I title stuff sucks. I wish I had more talent writing stuff, but… oh, well. Writing about seiyuus on Wednesday night after anime club meeting (or rather Thursday morning.) is actually one of my favorite thing to do. I don’t feel like going to bed before doing this, and I may or may not be tired, so please disregard any nonsense that may come up here.

It’s Sakamoto Maaya-san, and as you can from the title, she played as Nino-san. (now I’m not just respecting her, but calling her with the proper name, 2-3) I chose her since we just watched Arakawa season 2.

It seems that her name should be Maya, but in kanji, her name is 真綾, and 真 is ‘ma’ and 綾 is ‘aya’.

She works as both seiyuu and singer, and she worked with Kanno Yoko-san many times.

She debuted early, so it’s actually about her 15th year, which makes her debut about when she was 15. Man, I wish I started something when I was 15…

Her characters are usually someone with quiet voice, or with quiet personality.

Now, let’s see who she played.

Obviously, I needed to start whit Nino-san. I just love how “denpa” she is. Since we watched whole season 1, I don’t think I don’t need to describe her character…

{{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/shiki-280x300.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2010/10/shiki.jpg" width="280" height="300">}}

So, next up is Ryougi Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai (the translation would be Border of Emptiness, I think…) yet another “Shiki” created by Type Moon. Well, technically I shouldn’t use the word “another,” but that may be a spoiler to you, so I’ll take a break here. If you don’t want any spoiler, skip the next paragraph.

—Spoiler—

Ryougi (since there are just too many Shikis, I’ll refer her as Ryougi) has three personalities, and that is common for a child in Ryougi family. In fact, you need to have both male and female personalities to become a head of Ryougi family. Pretty weird family, if you ask me. Anyway, her female version is known as Shiki (式), and that’s the main Shiki you’ll see. The male version is also Shiki (織). “He died” 3 years after Ryougi got in a car accident, which is when Ryougi woke up from a coma. Ryougi feels empty after that and starts to use masculine language. Male Shiki was known to be violent and murderous, but that was a fake. She actually never murdered until she killed Rio. 「 」is the third personality, who is the real murderous one. By the way, I’m NOT trying to keep the name secret or anything. It’s the OFFICIAL NAME. I know. I hate Type Moon stuff, too. They just make things too complicated.

—Spoiler Ends—

Ryougi also can see death like any other Shiki, but she is the original. If Tohno’s (or Touno) eyes are overclocked processor, Ryougi’s are quad core one.

And I guess she becomes more powerful with her katana instead of a knife.

Next is Makinami Mari Illustrious, named after a Japanese destroyer and an English aircraft carrier.

She likes piloting Eva and fighting in it. She likes piloting so much that she is surprised that Shinji doesn’t want to pilot Eva. She also says that smell of LCL is good, but as you may know already, LCL has the smell of blood…… I don’t know about that. I personally think blood smells like iron, and I don’t really like it.

There’s so much secrets about her, like her purpose and all that. But one thing is known, and it’s official: Mari and Asuka (now Shikinami, also a destroyer, rather that Souryuu, an aircraft carrier) know each other, but Asuka is now…… Damn Studio Khara and Anno. You had to make Asuka pilot the Eva-03. Damn you all. I was so happy to see Asuka in the new movies with more positive personality…

And she won first in 2D-character-that-you-want-to-take-as-your-bride contest in Japan. (I’d vote for Asuka, but… Ah, whatever.)

Maaya-san also played Akashi-san from the Tatami Galaxy, Lunamaria Hawke from Gundam Seed Destiny, Takada Kiyomi from Death Note, Fujioka Haruhi from Oran High School Host Club, etc.

I heard her voice first (or it was the first time I knew who she was) in Tsubasa Chronicles as the singer of the first ED theme song, but I think it was after Kara no Kyoukai when I really noticed her voice. I think her voice sounds rather cool, and it’s pretty good in my opinion.

So, good bye for now. See you next Wednesday.

PS: I wanted to share those images, but they didn’t really fit in the article, so…

And if you can’t tell, that’s the people from Arakawa.

And this is what I found while watching The World God Only Knows.
