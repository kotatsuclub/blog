Double post lol

Anyway, this one’s short, just popping in to say I’ve figured out the video editing process and I’ll be uploading videos of my Rock Band customs to YouTube. Here’s a few to get started:

[Little Braver](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EzdxEGo1g "Little Braver")

[Shine Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOmGfMs3NFU "Shine Days")

[Alchemy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b-nQBcp1Pg "Alchemy")

If anyone’s got requests, put them in the comments or on the videos, and I’ll consider it.
