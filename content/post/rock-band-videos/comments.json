I’m still working on Railgun, just need to get a half-decent run on drums (and vocals, but that shouldn’t take more than a couple tries). The Demetori chart is going to take forever. The drums have a really awkward rhythm, and I keep missing the bass hit that goes in the middle of the red-yellow mess.\n\nIf you want, I can give you the charts themselves. There’s no specialized equipment you need to put them on the 360, just some free software and a USB drive that has a 360-formatted partition (and you need to uninstall the latest RB3 patch). Let me know if you’re ever interested, and I’ll tell you how.\n\nAs a final general comment, I won’t be spamming the blog with new posts every time I release new videos, so I’ll just drop comments here for announcements. If anyone’s interested in watching future videos, check back here or just subscribe to the channel.",
