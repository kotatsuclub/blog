Anime of the Week Before Last Week

Lets start at the beginning: Accel World. What would you use an ultra advanced brain acceleration program that allowed a human to surpass all of their physical limits for? Would you broaden scientific boundaries, enhance the quality of life for all of humanity, work for world peace. Well welcome to anime club, where the one of the greatest advancements in human history is used to pit tech integrated teenagers against each other in virtual battle. The rules are simple, once a member is infected with the Brain Burst program they have 100 points and can be called into battle by whoever. The winner takes points from the loser; if you lose all your points you DIE, in accel world, and can never rejoin ever. Why have points, so you can activate Brain Burst to do awesome things that shouldn’t be possible.

With the rules laid out lets start. Enter Haru Arita, as Dean Wormer famously said, “Fat, Depressed, and always playing squash alone is no way to go through life, son.” Arita has one thing in life, the high score at squash, which is broken by, wait for it, the school beauty, Kuroyukihime. She infects him with Brain Burst and Haru enters the exciting world of virtual fighting, overcoming personal issues, friendship, and other protagonist behaviors. After learning to fight, exchange ambiguous feelings with girls out of his league, and finding confidence the Accel World adventure is underway. Bonus props awarded for having a realistic wimpy protag.

Next is Natsuiro Kiseki. What happens when the omnipotent deity within a boulder decides to troll four young girls? In Natsuiro Kiseki you’ll find out. We start with four friends Natsumi: the standard leader, Saki: the blonde, Yuko: the free spirit, and Rinko: the chill/high as f\*\*\*. These girls are real BFFs and decide to make a wish on the rock. The rules are simple if four friends, hands on the Rock, make the same wish it WILL be granted. The girls wish to be idols, and friends forever adhering to the rules, but the Rock doesn’t do anything. The Rock, sits, waits, bides his time. Soon Natsumi and Saki fight they make up and all friends wish together, nothing happens, wish again, nothing, disagreement, more wishing, angsty girl fight, then finally all the girls notice the blue sky and pleasant breeze and BOOM 400 FEET UP. No warning, just big air, and the game is

afoot. While the girls deal with standard friendship issues the almighty Rock does whatever it wants. Yuko and Rinko make a vague semi-wish, boom Natsumi and Saki glued together, N and S working together finally boom, unstuck. Natsumi and Saki make a wish purely for revenge, boom Yuko and Rinko glued together. All four girls get together and fervently wish to fly again for the sole purpose of saving the friendship of two kids, Hell No. A great combination of friendship, middle school non-problems, and most important the invincible omnipotent troll anyone can root for. If you like mild humor, and indirect fanservice, you’ll like Natsuiro Kiseki.

Finally we come to Natsuyuki Rendezvous. How do make an Anime like this, a simple recipe. Take two cups of grated _Ghost_, one cup of _Sleepless in Seattle_, two teaspoons of _Paranormal Activity_, a pinch of _The 6th Sense_,and add some _Father of the Bride_ to taste; Mix in a blender on low until smooth, add 3 cups of ice, one bad haircut, blend on high for one minute, and garnish with flowers. A bittersweet romance about boy meets girl, meets ghost/emotional baggage, meets suspense. Hazuki, a shy man, decides to work in a flower shop after falling in love with the cute owner, Rokka. Despite her terrible haircut and his initial shyness Hazuki begins to get closer to her. The plan of slowly getting closer is thrown out the window after a fateful meeting with Rokka’s ex-husband , the ghost Atsushi, throws Hazuki’s plan of seduction into overdrive. Hazuki manages to overcome his initial silence and puts some decent moves on his target, a few intimate conversations and hasty romantic one-liners puts Atsushi on the defensive. Torn Atsushi wants, Rokka to be happy, but like all of us, can’t stand some smug bastard hitting on his girl in front of him. Atsushi fights back the best way an incorporeal, but visible entity can, by superimposing himself over Rokka. Thus with one blow he has

made all intimate interaction impossibly awkward. In the end it is a losing battle. Hazuki using the incredible advantage of actually being able to interact with Rokka begins to win her affections, and Atsushi switches from lawful neutral to evil in order to use dark magic techniques forbidden to benign spirits. Here we come to the true start of this tale. A woman caught between a human lover and poltergeist. Prepare for love, ghosts, and flowers in Natsuyuki Rendezvous. P.S. Why is there a z in rendezvous?
