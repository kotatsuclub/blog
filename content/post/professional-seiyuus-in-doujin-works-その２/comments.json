Their characters are so different it’s hard to believe (not to mention distracting when I was watching OreImo, all I could think was Ritsu). Marisa being voiced by Mio’s VA is also pretty amusing (though she voices Houki from IS, the tsundere childhood friend, so maybe it’s not so surprising after all). And I feel like Kitamura Eri is in everything I watch nowadays. Toradora, So-Ra-No-Wo-To, AB, Ga-Rei, even Freezing and Onii-chan this season.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should get a PSP just for all the Japanese stuff that comes out for it. But then I’d have to learn Japanese. Eh, maybe I’ll just stick to Touhou and bad anime."
