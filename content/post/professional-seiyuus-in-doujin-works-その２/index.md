+++

Remember I said I will post professionals in doujin works again? So here it is. I’m probably gonna do people from the show we watch tomorrow, so I thought I’d post this before it’s to late.

So, today’s doujin work is called 東方奇闘劇. Sorry, I don’t know how to pronounce that.

Anyway, you can watch the video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4uas67AWH0). It’s actually a series, but only the 3rd one has the voice. It’s a video made by AQUA STYLE. It’s basically a parody of Super Robot Wars, but they didn’t make the parody game. The quality of video is not so great, but the account that posted better one was terminated by YouTube.

- Satou Satomi-san as Hakurei Reimu

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/7-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/7.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


Her debut was in 2007, but her first notable role was in 2008 in Hell Girl. Her other roles include: Tainaka Ritsu from K-ON!, Shichijou Aria from Seitokai Yakuin Domo, and Tamura Manami from Ore Imo.

- Hisaka Yoko-san as Kirisame Marisa

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/3-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/3.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


Her voice sounds relatively same for many roles (unlike Satou-san who voiced Ritsu and Aria). Her debut was in 2007 like Satou-san, but she only had extra roles until 2009. It seems like she works with Satou-san quite lot.

Her roles are: Akiyama Mio from K-ON!, Satan from Umineko, Kumashiro Maya from Occult Academy, Amakusa Shino from SYD, and Kawashima Minami from Moshidora.

She was also in a VN called L@ve Once, and the character’s twin sister is voiced by Satou-san, and in Moshidora, the guy who listens to her character’s complains from time to time is voiced by the one who did Tsuda from SYD. I thought it was interesting.

- Yonezawa Madoka-san as Kochiya Sanae

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/5-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/5.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


It says her debut was in 2004, but her first main role was in 2009, in an OVA called Isekai no Sekishi Monogatari. My source only has 5 roles of hers, and I haven’t even heard of 3 of them. Two things I know are, Leviathan from Umineko, and Hirasawa Ui from K-ON!

- Asumi Kana-san as Nazrin

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/4-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/4.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


I think I mentioned her when I did “Kana Double Feature” post, (obviously that was not the title). Well, her roles are: Nyaruko(or Nyarlko. I personally like Nyaruko better) from that Nyaruko anime, Miya from Amagami (nishishishi), Ushiro Kana from Bokurano, Yuu from B★RS, and Irie from Angel Beats!

- Kitamura Eri-san as Tatara Kogasa

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/2-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/2.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


Her debut was in 2003, and she seems to be the most well-known seiyuu of all 6 in this video. Her roles are, Siesta 410 (or Chiester 410 as in the Umineko fighter game) from Umineko, Yasaka Mahiro from Nyaruko anime, Takagi Saya from HotD, Sayaka from Madoka Magika, Yui from Angel Beats!, and Nao from the new Oni-chan anime.

She seems to be everywhere lately…

And I found [this](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=chester+410&cp=4&qe=Y2hlcw&qesig=uwWCteMV4hVXa7UKMDlxPA&pkc=AFgZ2tlW1a61e0ub-6GtmxQIY7LaiFx-yXXIZGD108K2EStgdAjzQBrXH0bxKJFGk2MgFNvX6-rRgyvB_hcgVv43ALNydFEEqg&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=0p&aqi=&aql=&oq=ches&pbx=1&fp=ee5b8d49ec6ea034) when I was trying to find exact spelling of Chiester.

- Yamamoto Maria-san as Kumoi Ichirin

    {{<figure src="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/6-300x225.jpg" link="http://minesblog.com/anime/files/2011/01/6.jpg" width="300" height="225">}}


To be honest, I don’t really know much about her. Anyway, she was in MGS2 as E.E., and in Arcana Heart as Fiona.

Well, it’s the end. Next time will be the Touhou Castlevania, but I don’t know when it will be. Pictures are added this time to prove I’m not lying. (see the CV? That’s the seiyuu’s name, if you can read it) That’s just my excuse to post SD Touhou characters.

PS: It’s totally unrelated, but there’s going to be a B★RS game for PSP (yet another reason to get a PSP for me) and it’s going to be a standard JRPG, one of my favorite genre. Sadly, B★RS’s seiyuu is NOT going to be Hanazawa-san. The good news is, it’s going to be Sakamoto Maaya-san, and some other seiyuus I like will be there.
