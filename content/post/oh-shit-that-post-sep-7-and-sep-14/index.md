Hey guys. Long time no rant. I’ve been putting this off more and more, as you can probably see. I don’t have a convenient pocket in my schedule to make these posts like I did last year, so I’ve mostly just been doing homework and trying to figure out what my new desktop can do, which isn’t much.

But it can make these posts, so I guess I should. This time I’ll be going over both weeks. As a reminder, the shows we watched were: Hidan no Aria, Ano Hana, Legend of the Legendary Heroes, No. 6, Kami-sama Dolls, and Kami-sama no Memo-cho. I’ll probably make each ‘review’ a bit shorter than normal because I should be doing maths instead.

Since I’m obviously getting reluctant to do these posts, does someone maybe want to take over? It’s not a hard job, I promise, though it doesn’t pay nearly enough. Alternatively, maybe I’ll just switch to commenting on Steve’s previews, and we can just do that.

Anyway, here goes.

**Hidan no Aria**

Hidan no Aria was silly and also not very good. I can’t really say that it was an awful show, but I can easily say that I won’t be watching any more of it. If it had a bit more charm and tried to take itself a little bit less seriously it might be a good show to sit down and laugh at, but as it is now, it gets stale pretty quickly.

It’s basically a fanservice show that doesn’t have enough fanservice. When your main character’s “true abilities” only show when he gets turned on, you’re probably doing something wrong or horribly right. Though I’m reluctant to say it’s an idea that could be executed well, it was definitely done pretty badly in this show.

**Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Boku-tachi wa Mada Shiranai**

{{<figure src="assets/ano+hana+character.jpg" width="500" height="313">}}

Ano Hana, known as ‘Dat Flower’ to many in the club, was actually pretty good. The jump in quality from Aria to Ano Hana was clear from the get-go, and the show possesses a likeability that a lot of other shows just don’t have. The quickly jumps back and forth from being serious, to funny, to sad, but it does it well enough that it’s not getting in the way of the story.

I’ve already seen all but the last two episodes of this show, so I’ll be finishing it very soon. It’s a simple show, but it’s entertaining, charming, and seems like it’ll have a satisfying ending, for better or worse. I’d recommend this easily.

**Legend of the Legendary Heroes**

{{<figure src="https://blogs.emory.edu/animec/files/2010/09/legend-of-the-legendary-heroes-10-42.jpg" caption="Yeah, OK." width="640" height="360">}}

Legend of the Legendary Heroes was also interesting… but not in a good way. It started out pretty standard, with a cheesy fantasy setting, mostly boring characters (including the bored shounen hero with all the abilities in the world he doesn’t like to show off), and a pretty bland military story. Country versus country, etc. No one cares.

Then episode 3 shows up and everything goes to shit. This is a formula that sounds kind of familiar and has piqued the club’s interest before (Madoka, obviously), but the way it was done in this show was more than just shocking–it drew out of my more of a ‘Why?’ response than anything else. Suddenly perky girl is cradling her head in her lap, and everyone but the love interest(s) are dead. What? Why, show? It just didn’t seem handled well, and I don’t feel compelled to watch more.

**No. 6**

{{<figure src="http://anipulse.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/no-6-ep1-1.png?w=400&h=225" width="400" height="225">}}

No. 6 definitely wasn’t a horrible show. Despite its cheesy soundtrack, most of the presentation came together pretty well. It was definitely BL, and it made that pretty clear early on, but the characters weren’t overtly detestable, and despite the stale dystopian premise the show didn’t suck.

I won’t watch more of it because it didn’t really catch my interest, but I wouldn’t grimace if someone said they enjoyed it. If someone watches it and cool stuff happens later on, let me know.

**Kami-sama Dolls**

{{<figure src="assets/Kamisama_dolls.jpg" width="225" height="320">}}

Kami-sama Dolls wasn’t nearly as bad a show as I was expecting from the name. The animation is rather lackluster and the designs are mostly nothing special (“Hey, guys! Let’s spice up Love-Interest-san’s design with some bigger boobs! That’s a good idea, right guys?”), but it was never boring and somehow the cheesiness it had didn’t damage it.

I know some people were drawing similarities to Narutaru, and I would say I got a similar vibe from this show. I’m not expecting much like it (we already saw some graphic deaths, but only nameless guys…), but I’m considering watching more of this show. We’ll see.

**Kami-sama no Memo-cho**

{{<figure src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQvcNGTJDXGsuocdqtaxAFu14JESgdQl2h9UjLADq6Acs-hWFI_xUkrOX5f" width="253" height="199">}}

I actually liked this show quite a bit. The prevalence of NEETS reminded me a bit of Eden of the East, even though they’re pretty different shows. It was probably the best-animated show we watched that night, too. I found all the characters pretty interesting; even though none of them were really seen in any depth (as far as we watched), they were all personable and likeable from the beginning. Unfortunately, the mystery was sometimes a little predictable, but it’s something I can live with.

I am pretty sure I will watch more of this.

…And that’s it for the post. Cool. Alright, good night everybody. I’ll see you in a few days!
